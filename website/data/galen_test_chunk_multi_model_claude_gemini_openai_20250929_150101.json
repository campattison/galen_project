Reasonable arguments concerning these matters have also been stated by us in another work, in which we examined the elements according to Hippocrates. But now, which is the next step after that work, I shall proceed in this present writing to discover all the differences of mixtures [temperaments]—how many they are and of what kind—dividing them by species and genera, beginning with an explanation of the terms. For whenever they say that bodies are mixed from hot and cold and dry and moist, they assert that one must understand these in their extreme form, that is, the elements themselves: air, fire, water, and earth. But whenever they speak of an animal, or a plant, as hot, or cold, or dry, or moist, it is no longer in the same way. For no animal can be extremely hot, like fire, nor extremely moist, like water; and likewise neither extremely cold nor extremely dry. Rather, the designations arise from what predominates in the mixture: we call \"moist\" that in which there is a greater portion of moisture, and \"dry\" that in which there is more dryness; and similarly \"hot\" that in which the hot predominates over the cold, and \"cold\" that in which the cold predominates over the hot. This, then, is the usage of the terms.",

And I too have stated what is plausible on these matters in another treatise, in which I examined the elements according to Hippocrates. Now, however, as what follows upon that inquiry, I will in this book go through all the differences of mixtures—how many they are and of what sort—distinguishing them by species and by genus, beginning from an explanation of the terms.\n\nFor whenever people say that bodies are mixed from the hot and the cold and the dry and the moist, they claim that one should understand these in their extremity, that is, as the elements themselves—air, fire, water, and earth.

For no living thing can possess heat in the extreme, like fire, nor moisture in the extreme, like water; and likewise it cannot be cold or dry in the uttermost degree. Rather, the names are assigned from that which prevails in the mixture [krasis: blending/temperament]: we call “moist” that in which the portion of moisture is greater, and “dry” that in which dryness is; and so too “hot” where the hot prevails over the cold, and “cold” where the cold prevails over the hot.

The prevailing opinion of the most distinguished physicians and philosophers is that there is a moist and hot mixture, another that is moist and cold, and a third in addition to these that is dry and cold, and another that is both dry and hot. But some of them say that there exists a mixture that is both moist and cold, and another that is both hot and dry; however, neither one that is both moist and hot, nor one that is both cold and dry. For it is not possible either for moisture to accompany predominant heat, or for dryness to accompany coldness. For moisture is consumed by dominant heat, and thus the body becomes both hot and dry, while in those bodies in which heat is weak, it remains undigested and unprocessed, so that it is necessary that when heat predominates, dryness follows, and when coldness prevails, moisture follows. These people, then, have convinced themselves on these grounds that there are altogether two varieties of mixtures. But those who believe there are four oppose them in two ways: some by immediately not conceding the first premise, namely that it is necessary for moisture to be dried out by dominant heat; while others concede this point but dispute it in another way. Now the first group say that the function of heat is to heat, just as that of cold is to cool, and likewise the function of dryness is to dry, just as that of moisture is to moisten. And for this reason, those bodies that are by nature both hot and dry, like fire, insofar as they are hot, heat, and insofar as they are dry, dry.",

These people, then, have on these grounds persuaded themselves that all the differences of mixtures are only two.

Therefore, neither is it necessary that a hot mixture must also be dry, but it is possible that sometimes the hot may predominate over the cold in the mixture of a living creature, while the moist predominates over the dry. For indeed, generation, alteration, and change occur from contraries to contraries. For who, having said that the white thing has been altered and changed—for it has become hot—would not be ridiculous? For the argument seeks not the opposition between cold and hot, but the change in color. For the white changes into the black, just as the black also changes into the white, and the hot in turn into the cold, just as the cold also into the hot. And likewise the moist into the dry, and the dry in turn into the moist. For if someone should claim that a body has been altered because what was formerly moist is now white, or because what was formerly dry now appears black, he would not seem to be in his right mind. But if he should say that what was formerly moist has now become dry, or that what was previously black is now white, or that it has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would seem to be sensible and to speak reasonably. For what changes, insofar as it changes, must in that respect move toward its opposite. At any rate, we say that this person has become or is becoming musical, obviously from being non-musical, and literate from being non-literate, and skilled in rhetoric from being non-rhetorical. But to say that something becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being literate, or that something comes to be from some other heterogeneous quality is absurd. For it is possible that one who was formerly literate has now become musical, having acquired music in addition to literacy, not having lost his literacy. And yet if he has acquired something while the former quality remains, it is surely clear to everyone that he has not been altered with respect to what remains. So he has not become musical from being literate—for indeed he is still literate even now—but he has become musical from being non-musical. For it is no longer possible for him to remain non-musical, having already become musical. Since, then, all changes occur by contraries, from contraries, and into contraries, clearly the moist too, if it ever changes, insofar as it is moist, will itself be dried and what dries it will be called dry. Therefore, they say, let them not claim that it is impossible for a mixture to be both hot and moist at the same time. For it is impossible for the same thing to be both hot and cold at the same time, or both moist and dry at the same time; for contrary qualities cannot coexist in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be both moist and hot at the same time, and both cold and dry at the same time, as both the argument has demonstrated and the examples given a little earlier. Such, then, is the argument of the earlier thinkers.",

But the argument of those others does not demonstrate that there could never be in one and the same body the moist in excess of the dry and the hot in excess of the cold, but rather that such a condition could not persist forever. For the moisture, being constantly evaporated by the heat, will in time render the body dry; and thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but would be hot and dry. Then again, this very condition itself—the hot and dry—as time advances will become dry and cold. For when the heat has consumed all its moisture, from that point on, they say, it too begins to wither away, no longer having an abundant supply of the nourishment from which it was kindled. Therefore they consider it not at all remarkable that both at the beginning, right at the first generation of the living creature, either the moist runs together in excess of the dry, or the hot in excess of the cold, into the same place. And it is also possible that as time progresses, the mixture that was previously hot and moist becomes in turn hot and dry, just as again in turn the dry and hot mixture, when the heat is extinguished, becomes cold and dry.",

Their argument does not show that it could never occur in one and the same body that the moist exceeds the dry and the hot exceeds the cold, but rather that such a condition would not endure forever. For as the moisture is continually being dried out by the heat, in time it will render the body dry; and thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but hot and dry. And this very state, hot and dry, in due course will become dry and cold. For whenever the heat has consumed all its sap [ikmada, “natural moisture”], from that point, they say, it too begins to wither, no longer having an ample supply of nourishment from which it had been kindled. They therefore think there is nothing surprising if, at the beginning, immediately at the first generation of the animal, either the moist exceeds the dry or the hot [exceeds] the cold come together in the same subject. And it is possible also, as time advances, for the mixture that was previously hot and moist to become again hot and dry, just as again the dry and hot, when the heat is quenched, is brought to completion as cold and dry.",

Thus, a moist and hot temperament [κρᾶσις] can exist, whenever a great amount of both moisture and heat comes together at the same time, right at the first genesis of a living being. The argument of the other party, however, does not show that it could never happen in one and the same body that the moist exceeds the dry and the hot exceeds the cold, but rather that such a state would not last forever. For the moist, being constantly dried out by the hot, will in time render the body dry; and so it would no longer be hot and moist, but would be hot and dry.

For indeed, the notion that heat predominates in the hot temperament, or cold in the cold temperament, cannot even be conceived without first having grasped the well-tempered condition. For they discover the healthful regimen with reference to nothing other than that well-tempered nature: they prescribe cooling for a body that is hotter than it should be, and conversely heating for one that is colder; likewise drying for one that is more moist, and moistening for one that is drier—clearly always introducing what is deficient to counteract what is in excess, so as to produce a certain well-tempered and middle state. Therefore, I thought it proper that this condition, which they are always pursuing and with reference to which they correct the ill-tempered states, should be mentioned first by them. But they are so far from remembering it that they omit it entirely. \"But it has not been omitted,\" some of them say, \"for it is included in the hot and moist temperament.\" Then how is it that you do not say there are five temperaments in all, but rather four, if indeed you remember the best one? For one of two things must be the case: either one of the ill-tempered conditions has necessarily been omitted, or the well-tempered one has. Now I clearly know that they have omitted the well-tempered condition, based on what they maintain. For when they speak of a hot and dry, or cold and moist, or some other temperament, they claim that we should not understand these as referring to the extreme qualities, but that the designation is always made according to the predominating quality. But if they do not wish to admit that the well-tempered condition has been omitted, they will be shown to have omitted one of the others. For let it be granted that the moist and hot temperament is well-tempered, as they themselves wish. Then they have clearly omitted the condition opposite to the cold and dry ill-temperament, in which both the moist and the hot predominate.",

For the notion that, in a hot mixture [krásis], the hot element predominates, or in a cold one the cold element, cannot even be conceived unless one has first posited the well-tempered [state]. Indeed, when they devise a healthful regimen [diaita] they look to nothing else than that well-tempered nature: they bid the body that is hotter than is fitting to be cooled, and that which is colder to be warmed; likewise, the wetter to be dried and the drier to be moistened—always, plainly, introducing against the excess what is lacking, in order to produce a certain well-tempered and intermediate condition.\n\nAccordingly, that condition which they always pursue, and to which they look when they set right disequilibria [dyscrasiai], I thought ought to be mentioned first of all by them. Yet they fall so far short of remembering it that they leave it out entirely. “But it has not been omitted,” some of them say; “for it is included under the hot-and-moist.” And how is it that you say there are in all not five mixtures, but four, if you do in fact remember the best one? For of the two alternatives, either one of the disequilibria must have been omitted, or the well-tempered state. I, for my part, know clearly from what they maintain that it is the well-tempered state they have omitted. For whenever they speak of a hot-and-dry, or a cold-and-moist, or any other mixture, we should not understand them to be referring to the extreme qualities as such; rather, the designation is always derived according to what predominates. If, however, they are unwilling to let the well-tempered state be omitted, they will be shown to have omitted one of the others. Let the hot-and-moist, then, be well-tempered, as they wish. Plainly, then, they have omitted the mixture opposed to the cold-and-dry disequilibrium, in which the moist and the hot predominate.",

      "claude_translation": "For the same argument applies to both cases. Or else let us not blame excessively moist and hot conditions, nor acknowledge as diseases those hot ailments that are constituted with excessive moisture, nor agree that these are diseases at all. Now in fighting back against such arguments, some of the followers of Athenaeus of Attaleia engage directly, saying that they do not criticize a moist and hot condition, nor do they claim that any disease has been found that is moist and hot, but that every disease is necessarily either hot and dry, like fever, or cold and moist, like dropsy [edema], or cold and dry, like melancholy. And here they also call to mind the seasons of the year, asserting that winter is moist and cold, summer is dry and hot, and autumn is cold and dry, while they call spring a well-tempered season that is both hot and moist; and likewise among the ages of life, they say that childhood is well-tempered and hot and moist. They believe that its good temperament is demonstrated also by the activities of nature, which are especially vigorous at that time. And indeed they say that death leads the bodies of living creatures to dryness and coldness. At any rate, they say, corpses are called \"alibantes\" [without moisture], as no longer possessing any moisture or wetness, having been evaporated simultaneously through the departure of heat and frozen by the coldness. But if death is of such a nature, they say, it is now necessary that life, as being opposite to it, be both hot and moist; and moreover if life, they say, is something hot and moist, it is entirely necessary that the mixture most similar to it be the best, and if this is clear to everyone, that it be the most well-tempered, so that it turns out that a moist and hot nature is the same as a well-tempered one, and that good temperament is nothing other than the predominance of moisture and heat. Such then are the arguments of the followers of Athenaeus. And this same opinion seems somehow to belong also to the philosopher Aristotle, and to Theophrastus after him, and to the Stoics, so that they try to shame us by the multitude of witnesses. But as for Aristotle, how he understood the matter concerning hot and moist mixture, I could perhaps, if it should be necessary, demonstrate as the argument proceeds; for they seem to me to misunderstand him.",

But it is neither necessary to posit the fourth pairing of mixtures among the seasons, unless it also appears to be so, nor will comparing it to the seasons on either side prove it to be moist and hot any more than cold and dry. For if \"moist\" and \"hot\" are names of immoderation, the statement is not true according to them; for spring is moderate in all respects. But if, because it is moister than summer and warmer than winter, it is moist and hot, it should no less properly be considered cold and dry, because it is colder than summer and drier than winter. Or what is the justification for taking one quality from the opposition with winter, and one from summer? For since it differs from both in both respects, it ought not to have the comparison by halves, but to have it complete. And yet if it were done in this way, we shall say that opposite qualities belong to it. For it will be hot and dry if compared to winter, but again cold and moist if compared to summer. Therefore, according to neither comparison made completely will it be moist and hot.

But it is neither necessary to posit in the seasons the fourth pairing of the mixtures, unless it should also be evident, nor will comparing it with the seasons on either side prove it to be any more wet and warm, rather than cold and dry.

I shall first quote what he said about the disorder of the seasons, and next also the matters concerning the resulting destruction of people. In all these things I consider it worthwhile for you to pay careful attention and to observe, first, what sort of thing a hot and wet mixture is, as it is nothing like spring, a temperate thing; second, that it is necessary for everything to putrefy in it. Now Hippocrates begins his account as follows: \"A southerly year, rainy, with complete absence of wind throughout.\" Then to these things he adds the particulars of the entire condition, writing that many rains occurred in a hot and southerly condition, and then again bringing together the entire account into one summary at the end thus: \"The year having become,\" he says, \"entirely southerly, and wet, and mild, such and such things occurred\"—all of which would be too long to record in this present discourse; but it is possible for anyone who wishes, taking the third book of the Epidemics, to read the particulars, all of which are brought together into one summary: a very great putrefaction, which Hippocrates himself also mentions by name many times, sometimes speaking in this manner: \"And the discharge that formed was not like pus, but a certain other putrefaction, and the discharge was copious and varied\"; and at other times again thus: \"And carbuncles on the genitals during summer, and other things which are called putrefaction,\" and how from this putrefaction in many cases the entire arm and forearm fell off, and in many cases the thigh or the parts around the shin were stripped bare, and the entire foot.",

You would learn this if you observed both meats and all other things that are preserved by people—some prepared with salt, others with brine, others with vinegar, and others with some other drying agent—being preserved well. You would also learn that in the north wind, which is dry and cold by nature, all things remain free from putrefaction for the longest time; but they putrefy readily in southerly conditions. For this wind too is moist and warm. Consequently, we declare the complete opposite to those who suppose that spring is moist and warm.

But they both say that it is such and that it is healthful for this reason, erring in both respects—both in what can be discerned by the senses and in what can be examined by reason.

But to pay no attention to experience, and to attempt natural theory before having properly exercised the reasoning by which we would discover it, necessarily leads to such sophistries, and compels one to speak about observable phenomena as if insensible, and to call Aristotle as a witness while mishearing what he teaches. For he knows that \"hot\" is spoken of in many ways, as are \"cold,\" \"dry,\" and \"wet\"; but they do not hear him saying \"in many ways,\" but rather always in the same way. And indeed Aristotle has explained that it is not the same thing to be hot by some proper and innate heat or by an acquired and foreign heat; but they mishear even this. Furthermore, both Aristotle and likewise Theophrastus have stated precisely with reference to what one should consider nature to be well-tempered [eukratos] or ill-tempered [dyskratos]. But they do not understand even this; rather, when they hear them saying that the animal is moist and hot, or that the temperament [krasis] of a child is moist and hot, they neither understand how these things are said, nor do they foolishly transfer the argument to the seasons, as if it were the same thing—and not vastly different—for one's own temperament to be moist and hot or for the air surrounding us to be so. For it is neither the same thing nor is the temperament of an animal said to be moist and hot in the same way as the temperament of air is said to be moist and hot. Now I shall explain what was the cause of all these errors, and I shall show clearly to those willing to pay attention that small mistakes in what is taught at the beginning of logical theory become the causes of the greatest errors, and that there is a danger that all things done badly both in all the arts and indeed also in the actions of life follow from sophistries. These sophistries, therefore, follow from not having correctly distinguished the meanings. Rather, they suppose that \"hot\" is spoken of in two ways: on the one hand as unmixed and unblended and simple, on the other hand as prevailing in mixture with its opposite.",

But to pay no heed to experience and to attempt natural theory [physikē theōria] before properly exercising the reasoning by which we are going to discover it must necessarily lead to such sophistries, and even compel one to speak about the phenomena [phainomena] as if without perception, and to call Aristotle as a witness while mishearing what he teaches. For he knows that what is called “hot,” and “cold,” and “dry,” and “wet” are said in many ways; but they do not hear him as speaking in many ways, but always in one and the same way. And Aristotle went through the point that it is not the same thing for the hot to belong either as something proper and inborn [oikeion/symphyton] or as something acquired and alien [epiktēton/allotriōn]; and they fail to hear this too. Moreover, Aristotle, and likewise Theophrastus, have stated precisely what one must look to when judging nature to be well-tempered or ill-tempered [eukratos/dyskrasia]. But they do not even know this; rather, whenever they hear them say that the living creature is moist and hot, or that a child’s mixture [krasis, “temperament/constitution”] is moist and hot, they neither understand in what sense these things are said, and, in a dazed way, they transfer the account to the seasons, as though it were the same, differing only a little, whether one says that one’s own proper mixture is moist and hot, or that of the air surrounding us.

      "claude_translation": "But they also forget this: that we often, by comparing one mixture with another mixture, declare that one of them is hot. And indeed, animals are called hot and moist by the ancients not simply according to their own mixture, but when compared to plants and to dead things. For animals are hotter and moister than dead things and than plants. And moreover, when animals themselves are compared with one another according to species, the dog is drier, but the human is moister. But if you were to compare the dog to an ant and a bee, you would find those creatures drier, but the dog moister. So that the same animal happens to be dry in relation to a human, but moist in relation to a bee; and likewise also hot in relation to a human, but cold in relation to a lion. And it is not at all surprising if what is spoken of in relation to something else admits opposite predications at the same time. For this is not absurd, if the same body is called both hot and cold at the same time, but only if it is so in relation to the same thing. For it is not absurd that the same man is both right and left at the same time; but if he is right in relation to one person and left in relation to another, there is nothing absurd. Thus also a dog is both moist and dry at the same time, and both hot and cold at the same time, but not in relation to the same thing; for it is dry in relation to a human, but moist in relation to an ant, and hot in relation to a human, but cold in relation to a lion. And indeed it is also hot insofar as it is living; for if something is dead, it is not hot; but it is not hot in relation to another dog, if it happens to be so. All these things, then, are spoken of in relation to one another by comparison, but the expressions \"as within the genus of animals\" are used in another way, just as also \"according to a species of animal.\" For a dog, in relation to an ant and a bee, is moist, but as within the genus of animals, it is dry. But among dogs themselves according to species, this one is dry, that one is moist, and another, as a dog, is well-tempered [i.e., has a balanced mixture].",

So then there are these two meanings of hot and cold, and of dry and moist: one, when we speak simply, [refers to what is] unmixed and pure; the other [refers to what is] mixed from opposites, but is named by the term of the predominant [quality]. Thus in this way blood is called moist, as are phlegm, fat, wine, oil, honey, and each of the other such things. But bones and cartilage, nails, hooves, horns, hair, stones, wood, sand, and pottery have a smaller portion of the moist and a greater [portion] of the dry, and for this reason all such things are again called dry. An ant is dry and a worm is moist, as animals. And again among the worms themselves, this one is drier and that one moister, either simply as a worm or when compared to some other particular one. But what exactly is this very thing, whenever we speak thus—\"dry as a worm,\" \"hot as a man,\" \"cold as a dog\"—unless someone hears and understands it precisely beforehand, the entire argument must necessarily be confused. The precise [understanding] is what is also stated in the second book On the Diagnosis of Pulses: that each thing is then named according to genus or species—not only hot or cold or dry or moist, but also large and small, slow and fast, and each of such things—whenever it is beyond the proportionate and the mean; or [we say] an animal is hot whenever it is beyond the mean animal in mixture [i.e., temperament]; or a horse is hot whenever it is beyond the mean horse.

In these cases, the comparison to a human is a comparison to what is of the same species, whereas the comparison to a bee or an ant is to what is of the same genus; likewise, so too with any plant. For that is a genus superior to the animal, and likewise even stone, iron, and bronze belong to genera higher than this. Let, then, for the sake of concise exposition, the whole of such comparison be called “homogeneous” [homogenes], with only this distinction allowed in it: since we speak, in general, of some substance as well-tempered [eukratos, having a balanced mixture] and of another as drier and hotter, or colder and moister, we call “well-tempered” here that in which the opposed qualities have come together in exactly equal measure; and whatever falls short of this and has an excess in some respect, we designate by the name of the quality that has the excess. But whenever we say that some plant or animal is well-tempered, we no longer set the contraries against one another simply in such a class; rather, we take our reference from the nature of the plant or of the animal. Thus we call a fig tree well-tempered, if you will, whenever it is such as most befits the nature that ought to belong to a fig tree; and likewise a dog, a pig, a horse, and a human being, whenever each of these has its own nature in the best condition. Now this very thing—having one’s own nature in the best condition—is judged by the activities; for we say that any plant or animal whatsoever is in the best state when it is functioning at its best. For the excellence [aretē] of a fig tree is to bring to perfection figs that are both the best and the most; and similarly with the vine, to bear the most and finest clusters; for a horse, to run fastest; and for a dog, to be supremely spirited for hunting and guarding, and yet most gentle toward its own people. Accordingly, we shall say that all these things—both animals and plants—possess the best and the mean [i.e., the appropriate middle] mixture [krasis] within their own kind not simply when there is an exact equality of the contraries, but when there exists the proportion appropriate to its capacity. And we say something of this sort also about justice, assessing equality not by scale and measure, but by what is fitting and in accordance with worth.",

In these cases, the comparison to a human being is a comparison to something of the same species [homoeidēs], while the comparison to a bee or an ant is to something of the same genus [homogenēs], and likewise also to any plant whatsoever. For this genus is higher than that of the animal, just as stone and iron and bronze are from the genera above even this. Let such a comparison in its entirety be called \"of the same genus\" [homogenēs] for the sake of concise instruction; we make only this one distinction in it: that when a substance is said to be well-balanced in an absolute sense, and another substance is drier and hotter than this, or colder and moister, we call \"well-balanced\" here that which has come together from exactly equal opposites, while whatever falls short of this or exceeds it in some respect, we designate by the name of the quality that predominates. But when we say that any plant or animal whatsoever is well-balanced, we no longer compare the opposites to each other in an absolute sense in such a classification, but rather we make our reference to the nature of the plant or the nature of the animal, saying, for instance, that a fig tree is well-balanced whenever it is of such a nature as it is most fitting for a fig tree to have, and likewise a dog, and a pig, and a horse, and a human being, whenever each of these too is in the best condition of its own nature.

For the excellence of a fig tree is to bear the best and most numerous figs; and similarly for the vine, to produce the most numerous and finest grapes; for a horse, to run most swiftly; and for a dog, to be extremely spirited toward hunting and guarding, but most gentle toward its household members. Therefore, all these things—I mean both the animals and the plants—we shall say have the best and middle mixture [krasis] in their own genus not in an absolute sense, when there is exact equality of the opposites, but when the proper proportion for it exists.

And it is appropriate at times for the moist to be greater than the dry, and the hot than the cold. For a human being should not have the same mixture as a lion, a bee, and a dog. Moreover, to one who asks what mixture a human being is, or a horse, or an ox, or a dog, or any other thing at all, one must not answer simply. For it is not possible for things that are spoken of and judged in many ways to be beyond reproach when one has answered in a single manner. One must therefore do one of two things: either go through all the differences, or, having learned about what he was asking, state that one alone. For if he was inquiring, as among animals, what mixture it might be, one must make the answer looking toward the middle of all animals in mixture; but if simply and in relation to all substance, then one must now compare the opposites within it to one another, and examine them, no longer referring the mixture to the functions but to the masses of the elements. But if he asked by comparing it specifically to some particular thing, one must compare it to that alone. And even more, if we should be asked about any of the individual substances, for example, as it may be, Dion, or some particular dog, what sort the mixture is, one must not answer simply. For this provides no small opportunity for sophists to engage in trickery.

Therefore, whoever wishes neither to deceive himself nor to be tricked by another through sophistry, must begin from substances that are called simply hot, and cold, and dry, and moist, and thus proceed to the others, and first indeed distinguish this very thing concerning them: that not even these, even if they seem most especially to be spoken of simply, have escaped comparison with the commensurate homogeneous [standard].",

For if it is not necessary that what is hot must in every case be dry, but it is possible for it to be moist as well, then clearly it will also be possible for it to be intermediate; for the intermediate is closer to the dry mixture than the moist is. In the same manner there is also another cold mixture, in which the cold is stronger; however, it is not necessary for it to be either moist or dry, but it is possible for it to become intermediate as well; for again in this case you will apply the same argument.

And even if nothing had been said beforehand, it would be easiest to infer—once they have granted in the first place that there is one mixture that is wet and hot and another that is dry and hot. For if it is not necessary that what is hot be in every case dry, but it is also possible for it to be wet, then it will plainly also admit of an intermediate [state]; for the intermediate is nearer to the dry mixture than the wet is.

If, therefore, someone wishes to be skilled in diagnosing mixtures, it is appropriate for him to begin his training from the well-mixed and middle natures in each class. For by comparing the others to these, he will easily discover what is in excess or what is deficient in each. First, then, we must speak about those that are called simply well-mixed and ill-mixed, which we said are examined in all generated substance, not only in animals or plants. But again, even here, this much must be distinguished concerning terminology: that a hot mixture is one thing in actuality and another in potentiality, and that we say those things exist in potentiality which are not yet what they are called, but for which it is very easy to become so, possessing a certain natural aptitude for becoming. First, then, let us discuss those things that are actually hot and cold, and dry and moist, beginning from the whole of substance, and then let us proceed to animals and plants. For in this way what we have proposed will be completely accomplished by us. Since, therefore, the middle in every class, and especially in all substances, comes to be from the mixture of the extremes, it is necessary that both the conception and the diagnosis of it be established from those extremes. Now the matter of conception is very easy. For starting from the hottest of all things that come to perception—such as either fire or some water that is extremely boiling—and descending to the coldest of all things we know—such as ice or snow—and conceiving of a certain interval, we divide this precisely in the middle. For in this way we shall discover by conception the balanced [symmetron], which is equally distant from each of the extremes.",

For what is blended from the two will keep an equal distance from each of the extremes, both from the burning and from the numbing by cold. Accordingly, there is no longer anything difficult about this: by touching what has been mixed in this way, we can have the mean [meson] of the whole substance in the opposition of hot and cold, keep this in mind, and judge all other things by comparing them, as with a kind of rule. And indeed, by taking dry earth, or ash, or some other such precisely parched thing, and stirring it with water in an equal bulk, you will produce a body that is the mean in the opposition of dry and moist. Here too there is nothing difficult: by discerning such a body at once by sight and by touch, store it up in memory, and use this as a rule and criterion for diagnosing the presence of liquids and dries [i.e., moisture and dryness] in defect or in excess.\n\nLet the body being judged, then, plainly be moderately warm. For if it should be brought to the extreme of either heat or cold, this mean body of moist and dry will at times offer a false appearance, and will seem now to be moister than the due measure, now drier. For if it is heated more than it should be, as it melts and flows it will present an appearance of being moister than it is. But when it is cooled beyond what is fitting, it sets and congeals, becomes unmoving, and feels hard to the touch, and from this it projects a false appearance of dryness. If, however, just as it has shared equally in moist and dry, it were also at the mean of heat and cold, such a body would appear to the toucher neither hard nor soft.\n\nNow to commingle them wholly through-and-through—the hot and the cold, and the dry and the moist—is impossible for a human being. For earth kneaded with water is, one might suppose, mixed and thus all blended with all; yet such a thing is juxtaposition [paráthesis] in small particles, not mixture through-and-through [krâsis di’ holôn]. To blend both through-and-through is the work of god and of nature—still more so if hot and cold themselves were to be mixed wholes through wholes. However, to produce such a juxtaposition that each of the simple bodies escapes perception—this is not the work of nature or god alone, but also ours. For it is not difficult to produce a clay that is the mean of moist and dry from such a mixture; and likewise of hot and cold. And such a body will appear to you well-tempered [eúkraton] in respect of heat and cold, and also midway in hardness and softness.\n\nSuch too is the skin of human beings, precisely the mean of all the extremes—of hot and cold, and hard and soft—and most of all that of the hand. For this was destined to be the gauge [gnṓmōn] of all sensible things, fashioned by nature as a tactile instrument fitting for the most intelligent of animals. Therefore it had to be equally distant from all the extremes—hot and cold, and dry and moist. And in fact it has come to be from an equal-sharing of all these, not merely by being mixed, but by being blended through-and-through with one another—which none of us is able to accomplish, but is the work of nature.",

For what is blended from both will stand at an equal distance from each of the extremes, both from what burns and from what numbs through coldness. Therefore it is no longer at all difficult, having touched what has been blended in this way, to possess the middle point of all substance in the opposition between hot and cold, and to remember this, and to judge all other things by comparing them as if to some standard. And indeed, if you mix thoroughly dry earth, or ash, or some other such completely parched substance with water equal in volume, you will produce the middle body of the opposition between dry and wet. Therefore here too there is no difficulty, having distinguished such a body by both sight and touch simultaneously, to commit it to memory, and to use this as both a standard and criterion for the diagnosis of things deficient or excessive in wetness and dryness. But let the body being judged be moderately warm, obviously. For if it should be brought to an extreme of either heat or coldness, this middle body of wet and dry will sometimes present a false impression, and will seem at one time to be wetter than the moderate state, at another time drier. For if it should be heated more than necessary, melting and flowing, it will present an impression of being wetter than itself. But when cooled beyond what is appropriate, it both stands still and solidifies, and becomes immobile, and appears hard to those touching it, and from this projects a false impression of dryness. But if, just as it partook equally of wet and dry, so too it should be midway between heat and coldness, such a body appears to one touching it neither hard nor soft. Now to blend them completely through and through—I mean the hot and the cold, and the dry and the wet—is impossible for a human being. For earth kneaded with moisture is mixed, as it might seem to someone, and thus the whole is blended with the whole, yet such a thing is juxtaposition in small parts, and not a blending through and through, but to blend both completely through and through is the work of god and nature. Even more so, if the hot and the cold should be blended with each other completely through and through. However, to produce such a juxtaposition that each of the simple bodies escapes perception—this is not the work of nature or god alone, but is also ours. For it is not difficult to produce clay as a middle between wet and dry from such a mixture; and likewise also between hot and cold. And such a body will appear to you well-tempered both in heat and coldness, but also in the middle between hardness and softness. Such too is human skin, precisely midway between all the extremes—hot and cold, and hard and soft—and especially that on the hand.

Therefore it had to stand at an equal distance from all the extremes—hot and cold, and dry and wet.

And indeed, by as much as the driest part in a human being exceeds the skin in dryness, by so much in turn does the moistest part fall short of it. The argument now seems somehow to be touching upon the most useful matters themselves, and to be teaching, on the one hand, that man is the most well-tempered not only of animals but of all other bodies, and on the other hand, that among the parts in him, the inner skin of the hand has precisely escaped all extremes. Therefore, pausing again at this point in our argument, let us examine what sort of human being is best tempered of all—one whom we must place in the middle both of all substance and, even more so, of humans and other animals, and using him as a kind of standard and rule, comparing all others to him, we should call them hot and cold, and dry and moist. Many characteristics must converge together in such a person. For when examined in relation to all substance, such a person must appear to be in the middle, and even more so in relation to humans and animals. Now the characteristics of all substance have been stated previously in common; but those characteristics as they exist among species of animals are judged by the perfection of the activity appropriate to each. It is appropriate for a human being to be most wise, for a dog to be both most gentle and most courageous, for a lion to be most courageous only, just as for a sheep to be most gentle. And indeed that the activities of the body must be suited to the character of the soul has been demonstrated both by Aristotle in his works on the parts of animals, and has been discussed by us concerning these matters no less. This, then, is the method. But to train oneself to recognize readily in each genus of animal, and in all things generally, what is the mean—this is not the work of just any man, but of one who is extremely industrious and capable of discovering the mean through long experience and extensive knowledge of all particulars. Thus indeed sculptors, painters, statue-makers, and image-makers in general paint and sculpt the most beautiful examples in each species—for instance, the most well-formed human, or horse, or ox, or lion—by aiming at the mean in that genus. And a certain statue is praised, called Polyclitus's Canon, having received such a name from the fact that all its parts have precise symmetry with one another. Now the person we are now seeking is something more than this canon. For a human being who is well-fleshed in this way stands not only in the middle of moisture and dryness, but has also obtained the best formation—perhaps following from the good temperament of the four elements, but perhaps having some other more divine principle from above. But in any case, it necessarily follows that such a person is well-tempered; for the proper proportion in good flesh is the offspring of good temperament. Immediately such a body is also best disposed in its activities, and possesses moderately both hardness and softness, and heat and cold; and all these qualities belong to the skin, and especially to the inner skin of the hand, whenever it has no such callus as develops in those who row and dig. For since the hands have been made for a double purpose—touch and grasping—soft hands are more suitable for the precision of touch, while hard ones are more suitable for the strength of grasping. And indeed the skin that is the mean, not only of all human parts but also of all substance and all bodies subject to generation and corruption, is not the calloused, hard, and stone-like skin, but that which is in its natural state, by which we say that touch is especially perfected.",

      "openai_translation": "Accordingly, in all the parts that are harder than the skin—such as bones, and cartilages, and horns, and hairs, and nails, and ligaments, and armors [protective structures], and striking-parts [offensive structures]—the dry element is predominant; whereas in the softer parts—such as blood, and phlegm, and fat [pimelē], and suet [stear], and marrow, and the brain and spinal cord—the moist element is more abundant than the dry. And indeed, by just as much as the very driest part in a human being exceeds the skin in dryness, by so much again does the very moistest fall short of it. The argument now seems in a way to be touching upon their most useful features, and to be teaching at once that the human being is the most well-tempered [best balanced in qualities] not only among animals but among all other bodies as well, and also that, among the parts within him, the inner skin of the hand has precisely escaped every excess to the utmost degree. Let us therefore halt our discourse here again and inquire which human being is the best mixed of all—one whom we ought, after setting him in the middle both of the whole of substance and, even more, of human beings and the other animals, to use as a kind of rule and measuring-rod, comparing all the rest to him and naming them hot and cold, and dry and moist. Many marks must converge upon the same point for this: for the sort of person we examine must appear to be in the middle not only with reference to the whole of substance, but even more with reference to human beings and animals. Now the common marks concerning the whole of substance have been stated beforehand; but as regards animals, the criterion is the perfection of the activities appropriate to each. It befits a human being to be the most wise, a dog to be at once the gentlest and the most courageous, a lion to be the most courageous only, and a sheep the gentlest. Moreover, that the bodily activities ought to be fitting to the character of the soul has been shown by Aristotle in the Parts of Animals, and we too have spoken about these matters no less. Such, then, is the method. But to be trained to recognize readily, both in each animal kind and taken universally, the mean—not for just any man, but for one of extreme diligence, who through long experience and much knowledge of particulars is able to discover the mean—this is the task. Thus sculptors and painters, makers of statues and, in general, makers of images, represent and model the most beautiful example in each species—say, the most well-formed human being, or horse, or ox, or lion—by looking to the mean within that genus. And there is, I suppose, a certain statue that is praised, called the Canon of Polycleitus, which received such a name from possessing the exact commensurability of all the parts with one another. What we are now seeking goes beyond even that canon. For the well-fleshed man is set in the mean not only in respect of moistness and dryness, but he has also attained the best formation—perhaps as a consequence of the well-balanced mixture of the four elements, though perhaps it has some other, more divine principle from above. In any case, it necessarily belongs to such a person to be well-tempered; for symmetry within good flesh is born from good mixture. And immediately it belongs to such a body to be excellently disposed also for activities, and to possess a measured degree of both hardness and softness, and of heat and cold; and all these qualities belong to the skin, most of all to the inner skin of the hand [the palm], whenever it has no callus such as arises in those who dig and hoe. For since the hands have come to be for a twofold use—touch and grasping—the soft are more suitable for accuracy of touch, while the hard are more suitable for strength in grasping. Accordingly, the skin that is in the mean—not only among all human parts, but also within the whole of substance and among all bodies subject to coming-to-be and passing-away—is not the calloused and hard and stony skin, but that which is naturally constituted, in which, indeed, we say touch is most precise.",

For it is like a certain blood-containing sinew, being precisely intermediate between sinew and flesh, as if it came to be from a mixture of both. But every sinew is bloodless and cold; flesh, however, is full of blood and hot; and skin is intermediate between both, having become neither completely bloodless like sinew, nor full of blood like flesh. If therefore you establish this as a standard and as it were a criterion of all the parts of the animal, and examine and compare the other parts to it, you will find the eight differences of dyskrasia [imbalance of qualities] in them. And indeed I shall go through all of them in detail for you in order. Phlegm, then, is most moist and most cold, while blood is most hot, but not as moist as phlegm. Hair is most dry and most cold; bone is less cold and dry than it, and cartilage is less dry than bone. Next after cartilage comes ligament, and what they call chondro-ligament [cartilaginous ligament], then tendon, then membrane, and artery, and vein—obviously the bodies of the vessels themselves—then all the hard nerves. The soft nerves exist according to the nature of skin in the intermediate state with respect to moisture and dryness. For according to the other opposition, the soft nerve is no longer intermediate between hot and cold, but falls short of heat by as much as it also falls short of blood. Similarly also all the other parts mentioned previously are colder than skin by as much as they are more bloodless. And indeed the coats themselves of the most blood-filled vessels—I mean the artery and vein—are bloodless and cold by nature; but they are heated by their proximity to the blood, and arrive at an intermediate state of mixture. The blood itself in turn has its heat from the heart. For that organ by nature is of all the parts of the animal both most full of blood and most hot at the same time; and next after it comes the liver.",

It has been shown that there are nine differences of mixtures [temperaments], one being the well-proportioned and well-tempered, while all the rest are ill-tempered: four are simple, with one quality predominating in each—either heat, or cold, or dryness, or moisture—and four others occur whenever one power prevails from each pair of opposites. I mean two pairs of opposites: one according to hot and cold, the other according to dry and wet. After these matters, proceeding to the signs [of recognition], we examined the well-tempered nature, because this is first of all in excellence, in power, and in order of conception. Since what is called well-tempered is found to be one thing when spoken of absolutely in all the nature of existing things, but another thing according to each genus, it seemed necessary to examine first that which is investigated commonly according to all nature. Its standard and criterion was the equal proportion of the elements, through which what is produced as precisely the middle of all extremes is called well-tempered and well-proportioned. But the other things that are well-tempered according to each genus are judged by the proper activities and functions of bodies. And for this reason the same body of some animal or plant can be the middle of all things of the same kind—that is, well-tempered and well-proportioned in that genus—but ill-tempered when compared to some other genus of plants or animals or inanimate things. For the body of a living thing, when compared to that of a dead one, is moister and hotter. For example, if it should happen, a living lion compared to a dead lion, or one individual compared to himself, or one compared to another, is hotter and moister. And for this reason it has been said by the ancients that the animal is wet and hot, not meaning that moisture predominates in it absolutely, or heat. For in this way very many animals will be found to be cold and dry, such as gnats and mosquitoes, and flies, and bees, and ants, but rather as compared to dead ones. For even a living bee is moister and hotter than a dead bee, and an ant than an ant. However, when compared to a human being, and a horse, and an ox, and the other blooded animals, all such creatures are cold and dry in mixture. And indeed, even if you should examine them with reference to their whole substance, not even thus do they fall outside of being dry and cold.",

      "openai_translation": "That “moist” and “dry” body, and “hot” and “cold,” belong among things said in many ways, was distinguished in the preceding discourse. And it has been shown that there are nine differences of mixtures [krasis: the blend/temperament]: one is proportionate and well-tempered [eukratos], while all the rest are ill-tempered [dyskra­tos]—four simple ones, in each of which a single quality predominates, whether heat, or cold, or dryness, or moisture; and four others, when in each opposition the one power prevails. I call “oppositions” two: one according to hot and cold, the other according to dry and moist. Proceeding in order from these to their marks, we shall examine the well-tempered nature, because this is first of all in excellence, in potency, and in the order of understanding.\n\nSince “well-tempered” is found said in one sense absolutely throughout the whole realm of beings, and in another sense within each genus, it seemed right to begin with the first—the one investigated commonly with regard to every nature. Its rule and criterion was the equal sharing of the elements [isomoiria], by which that exact middle of all extremes, once achieved, is called both well-tempered and proportionate. As for the other cases, those well-tempered within each particular genus are judged by the proper activities and functions [energeiai and chreiai] of the bodies. And for this reason the same body of some animal or plant may be the mean among all its homogeneous kind—that is, well-tempered and proportionate within that genus—yet be ill-tempered when compared with some other genus, whether of plants, or of animals, or of inanimate things.\n\nFor the living body, compared with the dead, is moister and hotter. For example, a living lion, as against a dead lion—whether the same individual compared with itself at another time, or one lion with another—is hotter and moister. And it is for this reason that the ancients said the living creature is moist and hot—not as though moisture or heat simply predominated in it. For otherwise a great many animals will be found cold and dry, such as gnats and mosquitoes, and flies, and bees, and ants—but this is in comparison with the dead. For a living bee is moister and hotter than a dead bee, and an ant than an ant. However, when compared with a human being, a horse, an ox, and the other blooded animals [enaima], all such creatures are cold and dry in their mixture. Indeed, even if you were to examine with reference to their whole substance, not even then has it ceased to be the case that these are dry and cold.",

For it has been demonstrated previously that man is the most well-tempered not only of animals or plants, but also of all other things. Since he is composed of many and different parts, it is clear that what is mean in mixture of all things, this is also the most well-tempered in an absolute sense. For the mean part in mixture of the animal that is mean is the most well-tempered of all things in an absolute sense. It was shown that this in man is what is called the skin, and especially the inner part of the skin of the hands, provided that, as it has been fashioned by nature, it is preserved in such a condition. And indeed it was also said previously that the skin of not every man is the mean in an absolute sense of all substance, but only of whoever is most well-tempered; for there is great difference even among human beings themselves in relation to one another. The most well-tempered person is one who appears in body to be precisely mean between the extremes—of thinness and thickness, of softness and hardness, and further of heat and coldness. For it is possible to find by touching each of the human bodies either a wholesome and vaporous heat, or a fiery and sharp one, or neither of these but some predominating coldness. One must understand \"predominating coldness\" as in the body of an animal, and one that is both blooded and moist at that. Such, then, in body is the well-tempered man.",

And this is especially the case with pigs and sheep, since they are the moistest; goats, on the other hand, because they are drier, are both better and sweeter to eat. Conversely, as compared with young sacrificial animals, those that are aged are quite dry, tough, and sapless, and so are all their bones and all their ligaments; their flesh, arteries, veins, and sinews, because of age, are sinewy and hard, unpalatable and sapless, like straps. Those that stand between these extremes and the newborn—of those that have already advanced in years, the more they fall short of old age, the more they also fall short of the extreme of dryness; whereas the younger ones, which are still growing, have receded from the moisture of embryos to the same degree as they have advanced in age. The prime [akmē: peak of vigor] of all animals is set in the middle between the extremes, arriving neither at the utmost dryness, like old age, nor established in much moisture and flabbiness, like the age of infants. Why, then, did some reputable physicians declare that old age is moist? Plainly, were they not deceived by the abundance of superfluities [perittōmata: waste humors]? For their eyes water, their noses are filled up with catarrh, in the mouth an abundance of saliva collects; they also cough and bring up phlegm, thereby indicating that the lung is full of such a humor; and their stomach too is filled with phlegm, and each of the joints is mucous. Yet none of this is contrary to the fact that the bodies of the elderly are dry. For you will find the sinews [neura: tendons/ligaments], arteries, veins, membranes, and coats of all the organs much drier than before, with some phlegmatic humor or mucous moisture spread about them both within and without.",

And this condition particularly affects pigs and sheep, because they are especially moist. But goats, because they are drier, are both better and more pleasant to eat. Conversely to young sacrificial animals, aged ones have all their bones and all their ligaments quite dry, lacking moisture, and lacking juice, while they have sinewy and hard flesh, and their arteries, veins, and sinews on account of their age are unpleasant and lacking juice, like leather straps. But those animals that are between these and those just born—those that have already advanced in age are removed from extreme dryness by as much as they fall short of old age; while those that are younger and still growing have departed from the moisture of embryos by as much as they have advanced in age. The prime of life of all animals is established most of all in the middle between the extremes, neither having reached the extreme of dryness, as in old age, nor being situated in much moisture and flabbiness, as is the age of infants. Why then have some of the distinguished physicians declared old age to be moist? Surely they were deceived by the quantity of waste products? For their eyes water, their noses fill up with mucus, an abundance of saliva collects in the mouth, and they also cough and expectorate phlegm, thus showing that the lung too is full of such humor; and their stomach is filled with phlegm, and each of the joints is slimy. But none of these things contradicts the fact that the bodies of the elderly are dry. For you will find the sinews, arteries, veins, membranes, and the coats of all the organs much drier than before, but plastered around them both inside and outside either some phlegmatic humor or a slimy moisture.",

Yet concerning the age of children and of those in their prime, there is neither agreement among the physicians nor is it easy to resolve their disagreement. For the arguments on either side are plausible—both those who declare that children are hotter than those in their prime, and those who, conversely, maintain that those in their prime are hotter than children.\n\nThe former argue that of all the things naturally present in a living creature the humor [chymos; bodily fluid] of blood is the hottest; and that what is in the womb at first is almost nothing but blood, whereas later, as the parts are being shaped, one portion becomes bone, another artery, another vein, and another something else—yet all are red and share in a very great quantity of purest and hottest blood. From this they infer that the embryo is the hottest; and if that is so, children—so far as they are nearer to embryos—are hotter than those in their prime.\n\nThe others argue that there is much blood even in those at their prime, and more than in children—so that on this account they frequently suffer hemorrhages; and further, that the humor of yellow bile, being much hotter than blood, is present in them in great quantity. For this reason they declare those in their prime to be hotter than children.\n\nAgain, from activities, the former say that in children the heat is strong, since they both grow and desire and master foods in quantities greater than in proportion to the size of their bodies. The others say that growth in them is due rather to moisture than to the strength of heat, and that in digestion they not only do not excel, but fall far short of those in their prime. For they say that children experience vomitings in which their foods are thrown up undigested, and discharges of fluids that are thin, rough, and lacking in proper humor. And if they crave more, this contributes nothing, they say, to the strength of heat. First, animals do not crave on account of excess of heat; rather, quite the opposite—whenever the appetitive parts are chilled, they crave. Next, since food is employed by them not only for nourishment but also for growth, they therefore need more foodstuffs.\n\nMoreover, in all other activities, and very plainly, children fall short of those in their prime. For they neither walk, nor run, nor carry burdens, nor in general perform any of the practical activities in the same way; and even their sensations and thoughts, they say, in those at their prime reach the peak of excellence. In a word, the one is still imperfect, while the other is already a perfect animal. And in the perfect, they say, it is reasonable that the most active and most ruling of the elements should prevail.\n\nFurther, the greatest number of sleeps are seen to occur in children, and the fewest in those at their prime. And one would hardly suppose—no, not even in madness—that sleep arises otherwise than when the heat is somehow overcome and weighed down by an abundance of moisture; as one may see in those who are drunk, and again in those who have bathed too much. Thus poppy [opium], mandrake, lettuce-juice, and all things that render the mixture more moist and cooler are soporific. Such, then, are some of the disputes on either side concerning the tempering [mixture, temperament: krasis] of the ages in question.",

For they say that vomiting of undigested food occurs in children, and evacuations of moist, rough, and unconcocted matter. And if they desire more food, they say this has nothing to do with the strength of heat. For first, animals do not desire food through an excess of heat, but quite the opposite—when the appetitive parts are cooled; and secondly, because their nourishment is distributed not only for nutrition but also for growth, for this reason they require more food.\n\nAnd indeed, in all other functions they say that children very clearly fall short of those in their prime.

Consequently, their demonstrations come to be through one another and from one another: from the matters now being investigated, as if they were already known, whenever they discuss functions and discover the power of foods and drugs, and examine sleep and other such things. But again, conversely, they demonstrate the matters now before us through those things, as if they were already known in advance. But I do not approve of such demonstrations, and, if the truth must be told, I do not even consider them to be demonstrations, as I have shown more extensively in other works. And I say it is better, in every teaching, to define the order of concepts. If, therefore, the investigation concerning the elements is the beginning of the entire treatise on mixtures—whether they are impassive and completely unchangeable, or whether they are capable of being altered and changed—and if, after knowledge of those matters, the second in order is the account now before us, one must not take proofs for them from things not yet known, but, as is right and just, what is to be taken for the demonstration ought to be either something self-evident or something previously demonstrated. Therefore, one must make no mention of the generation of sleep, nor of digestion, nor of growth, nor of any other such thing, but let the investigation proceed from the bare and simple substance of the underlying matters alone, just as we have done in the first book. For having distinguished that what exists in actuality [kat' energeian] is one thing, and what exists in potentiality [kata dynamin] is another, we said that the account must first be made concerning what is already actually hot, cold, dry, and moist; then, in this way, to arrive at things existing in potentiality.

If they have from anywhere else both a notion and a discernment of hot and cold, let them tell us; for they promise some impossible kind of wisdom—or rather, to tell the truth, a sort of stupefaction—if they possess, for sensible things, some criterion older than sensation. And if no other criterion is available for things that are hot in actuality [kat’ energeian], let them now touch in succession many persons—men, old men, youths, children, and infants—for in this way they will discover those who are more and less warm. But if they demand rational demonstrations [apodeixeis] about sensible things, it is time already to examine even about snow itself whether we must regard it as white, as it appears to all human beings, or not white, as Anaxagoras declared; and likewise to review pitch and the raven, and everything else. For surely one ought not to distrust one’s eyes when they see what is white, but then, without demonstration, to trust them in the case of what is black. Let them, then, pronounce all the deliverances of the senses untrustworthy, and say neither that the swan is white unless they first investigate it by reasoning, nor that gypsum, or day, or the sun itself is so. And so let them likewise distrust their hearing about sounds, their nostrils about smells, and their touch about all tangible things. Then is not this the Pyrrhonian impasse and endless babble? And was it not just, indeed, that those who have chosen the best school among those in philosophy—the one that posits hot, cold, dry, and wet as principles and elements—should not be led so far astray from the men who laid down these doctrines as not to know that the beginnings of every demonstration are things evident to sensation and to thought [noēsis], and that whoever is at a loss about these seeks about other things in vain, having even abandoned himself, with no place from which to begin? Whence, then, they turned aside into so long a wandering, and undertook to seek by reasoning a discrimination of sensible things, I for my part cannot even imagine. For this reason I judge what is hot in actuality by touch; but if something is not yet hot, though it is apt to become such—what is called hot in potential [dynamis]—I try to discover this by reasoning. As for those others, I do not know how, but everything has been turned upside down for them, and they have cultivated long-winded rhetoric about arguments. Let us leave such people, reminding ourselves at least of this much even now: that the single source of corrupt doctrines is to have examined nothing beforehand about demonstration, but to investigate the matters straightaway and to attempt to demonstrate as if they were already knowing what a demonstration is. Returning, then, again to the point at issue, let us judge first and especially by touch what is warm according to the stages of age. Our judgment will be best if it concerns one and the same body of a single infant. For it is not impossible to remember what sort of warmth it previously possessed when it belonged to a given age, and what sort it has now, after two or three years have intervened, if it so happens. For if there should appear to be, in general, some change having occurred in the infant toward heat or cold, it will no longer be difficult to infer the superiority that will obtain up to the prime of life. And if you should wish to compare several children with many who are in their prime, compare the slender with the slender, the well-fleshed with the well-fleshed, and the stout with the stout; and likewise those who are alike in complexion, and in all other respects as far as possible. For when seeking to discover the difference that comes with ages, you would examine more securely in cases of natures as similar as possible. To investigate among opposites carries no small fallacy—not on account of the difference in the bodies tested that sometimes arises from age, but because of an underlying natural mixture [krasis, constitutional temperament].",

But if they have a concept and discrimination of hot and cold from some other source, let them tell us; for they profess a certain impossible wisdom, or rather, if one must speak the truth, madness, if for perceptible things they have some other criterion older than perception. And indeed, if there can be no other criterion for things actually hot, let them now touch many men in succession, both old men and youths and children and infants; for in this way they will discover those who are more and less hot. But if they seek logical demonstrations for perceptible things, it is time to examine even snow itself, whether one should consider it white, as it appears to all people, or not white, as Anaxagoras declared; and moreover to investigate similarly concerning pitch and the crow, and all other things. For surely one should not distrust the eyes when they see white, but trust them without demonstration in the case of black things. Therefore, declaring all the senses untrustworthy, let them not say that the swan is white, unless they first examine it by reason, nor lime, nor daylight, nor the sun itself. And in this way let them also distrust hearing concerning sounds, and the nostrils concerning odors, and touch concerning all tangible things. Then are these not Pyrrhonian doubt and endless nonsense? Yet it was not right for those who chose the best school in philosophy, the one that posits hot and cold and dry and moist as principles and elements, to wander so far from the men who established these things, as not to know both that the principles of all demonstration are things evident to perception and thought, and that whoever doubts about these things seeks in vain concerning other matters, having left himself no starting point. How then they turned to such lengthy wandering and attempted to seek by reason the discrimination of perceptible things, I cannot even conceive. And for this reason I judge what is actually hot by touch; but if something is not yet hot but suitable to become such, which is indeed called potentially hot, this I attempt to discover by reason. But for them somehow everything has been overturned, and a long rhetoric about arguments has been practiced. Let us then leave these people, reminding ourselves at least of this much even now, that one origin of bad doctrines is not having considered anything about demonstration beforehand, but simultaneously seeking the facts and, as if knowing what demonstration is, attempting to demonstrate. Returning therefore again to the matter at hand, let us judge primarily and especially by touch the heat according to the ages. Our judgment will be best concerning one and the same body of a single infant. For it is not impossible to remember what sort of heat existed for him when he was two years old, and what sort it is now, if two or three years have passed in between. For if any change toward hot or cold should appear to have occurred in the infant, it is no longer difficult to infer the superiority that will exist up to the prime of life. But if you wish to compare several children with many men in their prime, compare lean ones with lean, well-fleshed with well-fleshed, and fat with fat; and likewise compare those having similar complexions, and all other things as far as possible. For seeking to discover the difference in ages, you would examine more safely among natures that are as similar as possible. But examining among opposites involves no small error, since sometimes the difference of the bodies being tested is not due to age, but to a naturally existing mixture [temperament].",

Let us therefore judge by sensation what is a hot and cold body—at least one that is already such in actuality and no longer potentially—setting aside both the primary judgment and all other signs. And indeed I release you to judge well according to experience, but I shall interpret my own judgment myself. For having carefully touched many bodies in succession, not only of children or infants, but also of youths and those in their prime, I found that neither group was speaking the truth, neither those who said that a person in their prime is simply hotter, nor those who said colder than a child. For if you remove all other external alterations and examine only the differences arising from age, neither appears to you to be simply hotter. For their heats differ in quality due to unequal transpiration, on account of which some people, deceiving either others or themselves, believe that the heat of the child is stronger, while others believe that of the young man is stronger. For the heat of children is more vaporous and abundant, and more pleasant to those touching them, while that of those in their prime possesses something rather sharp and not pleasant. This difference in the impression persuades most people to declare that the body of those in their prime is hotter. But this is not the case. For to one who has trained his touch to distinguish stronger, weaker, and equal heat in different materials, I know well that the heat of children will appear to him either equal in strength to that of those in their prime, or greater. And this is the training—for one must begin from the most evident things. Sometimes the air in the baths is so hot that no one can bear it, but seems to be burned, and sometimes so cold that one cannot sweat. And indeed that there is a third condition besides these, which we especially need, the well-tempered one, I need not say. The same three conditions appear in the water of the swimming pool. For it is often found to be so hot as to burn from it, and cold so as not even to warm, and well-tempered so as to warm moderately. If therefore I should ask you which is hotter—the well-tempered water or the well-tempered air—you could not say either one.",

      "claude_translation": "For when both are equally pleasant and proportionate to the body, I consider it senseless to say that one of them is hotter and the other colder. And indeed, if you conceive of the water in a basin reaching an extreme of heat so as to boil, or the air being completely inflamed, it is obvious that you will be burned by both in the same way. But if again you conceive either of water so cold as to be already near freezing, or of air completely chilled, as happens in snowstorms, it is clear that by both of these likewise you will be equally chilled and shivering. Therefore you will conceive of extreme heat occurring in air in the same way as in water, and likewise extreme cold, and the middle point between each of the extremes occurring similarly in both; so that all the intervals between the extremes and the middle point will have the same degrees of difference and distances in both water and air. And you will say that one is sometimes hotter than the moderate by as much as the other. And in the same way you will say that water is sometimes colder than the moderate by as much as air is. And yet the particular quality of contact was not the same for each. For temperate water does not strike us in the same way as temperate air. And why need one speak of things so dissimilar? For even when the air itself is similarly hot, different contacts occur depending on whether it is at one time misty and vaporous, at another time smoky and sooty, and at another time perfectly clear. Therefore in many different conditions an equality of heat occurs, deceiving the unobservant as being unequal, because it does not appear similar in every respect. But it belongs to a man who has reasoned through the calculations I have mentioned, and who has trained his perception through much particular experience, to discover the equality of heat both in children and in those in their prime, and not to be deceived by the fact that one appears to be upon a moist substance and the other upon a dry one. For indeed a stone can sometimes receive the same degree of heat as water, it making no difference that the stone is dry while the water is moist. Thus, having examined thousands of times both children and many young men and youths, and the same person as child and infant and youth, it appeared to me that a person in his prime is no hotter than a child, nor is a child hotter than one in his prime. But, as has been said, only in children is the contact of heat more vaporous and abundant and pleasant, while in those in their prime the contact of heat is slight and dry and not similarly pleasant. For much flows out from the substance of children, which is moist, but little from that of those in their prime, which is dry. Therefore neither of them appears simply hotter, but one appears so by the abundance of transpiration, the other by its sharpness. For the child has more innate heat, since his generation is from blood and seed, and it is more pleasant; but in those in their prime the contact of heat is slight and dry and not similarly pleasant.",

But if these things were so, none of the hard parts in the human body would be moist. For it is not possible for such a degree of cooling to occur in it that something would become hard through solidification. For what was previously fluid will at some point arrive at a certain consistency, just as fat does. For the oily substance in blood, being fluid and greasy, when it comes to be in a cold place, solidifies, yet even so it does not become hard. Therefore it has been rightly stated by the ancients that fat is the most moist, and second after it comes the fleshy kind, and there are several forms of this. First is flesh properly so called, which you would not find anywhere in the body by itself, but it is always a part of a muscle. Next comes the particular substance of each of the viscera [internal organs]. The followers of Erasistratus call this parenchyma [the tissue poured in beside], and they think of it as something small and trivial, not knowing that the function of each viscus belongs to this flesh.",

Yet if matters stood thus, none of the hard parts in a human body would be moist. For so great a cooling cannot occur in it as to harden something through congealment [pexis]. What was previously fluid will indeed at some point attain a certain consistency, as fat [pimelē] does. For the oily element in the blood, being fluid and unctuous, when it comes into a cool region congeals—but even so it does not become hard. Accordingly, the ancients have spoken rightly: the moistest is fat [pimelē], and next after it comes the fleshy kind, which has several species. First is what is properly called “flesh” [sarx], which you would nowhere find by itself in the body, but is always a part of muscle. Next is the proper substance of each of the viscera, which those around Erasistratus call “parenchyma” [the organ’s native substance], and they deem it a small and paltry matter, not realizing that the specific activity [energeia, function] of each organ resides in this flesh.",

All these parts, however, are not only moister than skin but also colder, and in general everything bloodless is colder than what contains blood. The nature of the soft sinews [nerves] is very close to skin; but that of the hard ones is like skin itself, clearly in respect to moisture and dryness. For in heat it falls short to the degree that one would expect the completely bloodless to fall short of a body containing blood. The flesh of the spleen, the kidneys, and the liver is moister than skin to the degree that it is also softer; but it is hotter to the degree that it is more full of blood. And indeed the flesh of the heart is drier than all these to the degree that it is also harder; but it is hotter not only than these but also than absolutely all the parts of the body. And you can clearly learn this through perception in the dissections of animals that are performed at the chest, by inserting your fingers into the left ventricle of the heart; for you will find this region hotter than all the others by no small amount. But the flesh of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung is simple in nature, having grown around the arteries, veins, and sinews [nerves] in each internal organ. The form of the flesh of the heart, however, is not simple, but such as are the fibers in the muscles, around which the flesh has solidified, such also are those in the heart. Except that the kind of fibers is not the same, but those in the muscles are parts of sinews [nerves] and ligaments. The kind of fibers of the heart is distinctive, just as also that of the coat of the artery and vein, and of the intestines, stomach, uterus, and each of the two bladders. For indeed in all these organs one can see their proper flesh solidified around their own fibers. These fleshes, then, are hotter than skin, but the fibers, some more and some less, are slightly colder and drier than skin, and some are entirely similar to the substance of skin. All membranes are now drier than skin, just as also the meninges around the brain and the spinal marrow; for these too are membranes. And indeed all ligaments, to the degree that they are harder than skin, to that degree are they also drier. And the tendons, even if they are softer than ligaments, are at any rate clearly harder than skin. Cartilages come after the ligaments. And there is a certain body intermediate between both; some of the anatomists call it a neurocartilaginous ligament. This is a hard and cartilaginous ligament.",

For the previously mentioned things also follow, but rather they are completely inseparable: hardness accompanies dryness, and softness accompanies moistness, at least when it is combined with mild warmth. But also thickness and thinness of bodily condition follow from mixtures, not only from the innate ones, but even if some acquired mixture should come about from long habit.

And in the case of those who suffer badly from hunger, he says, one must consider the proper measures from these factors—namely from the width and narrowness of the vessels, not from the other constitution of the whole body.

The causes of what has been said are already clear, even if I do not speak them, at least to those who pay attention. But since not everyone pays attention, it is perhaps necessary to say something for their sake as well. Whatever in the blood is rich and light and thin, in hotter bodies this becomes nourishment for the heat, but in colder bodies it is preserved. And when it is filtered outside the veins, whenever it encounters cold parts, such as the membranes are, it congeals around them; but in parts that are naturally hotter (and such are clearly the fleshy parts), it is both consumed by the heat and dispersed, unless at some point, in addition to a colder mixture [of humors], the softness of one's regimen should also cause fat to accumulate even in the fleshy parts themselves.

And those who are naturally well-tempered but live lazily and without exertion also become fleshy. For this too has been most excellently stated by the ancients, that habits are acquired natures. And perhaps it will make no difference, having said this once, not to distinguish any longer in each chapter whether someone has become colder by nature or from habit, but rather to leave this to the readers, while I myself, for the sake of brevity, go through the bodily conditions proper to each of the temperaments. Now there are some people who are both thin and have small veins, but if you were to cut any one of them, fat appears, clearly having grown beneath the skin along the inner membrane. Such a condition is rare in men, but is found very frequently in women. For it is a sign of a colder nature and a more inactive life. For fat always comes about through coldness of condition; but fleshiness is the offspring of abundance of blood; while being well-fleshed is a sign of a well-tempered nature. Certainly, then, the fleshy immediately have more fat than the well-tempered; however, the fat does not always increase proportionally with the flesh, but one can see among the stout that some have more flesh, others more fat, while in some both have increased equally. Now in those in whom both have increased equally, there is as much more moisture beyond the well-tempered nature as there is also cold.

Following upon this is the diseased dyskrasia, namely when the living creature is sick on account of dyskrasia. For indeed it is not on account of this alone, but also according to not a few other conditions, concerning which more will be said in the discussions about the differentiation of diseases; but now the argument must be taken up again from the beginning. For just as, when the innate heat preserves the best eukrasia [good balance], the moisture being increased within healthy limits renders the person not fat but fleshy, with the fat also increasing slightly, but the flesh in a much greater measure—so again, conversely, if the moist and the dry should preserve an exact symmetry [proportion] with one another, but the person should be less hot, this body must necessarily become more fat than fleshy. But if, on the other hand, the hot should be increased, while the other opposition [between moist and dry] remains in symmetry, the living creature will be more deficient in fat than in flesh; just as, if the dry should at some point prevail, while the other opposition remains in symmetry, the body will be at once both leaner and harder. These things have been stated by me, and it is now clear that the simple dyskrasias belonging to the bodies of living creatures have been demonstrated not by argument alone, but also that the distinguishing signs of all of them are evident; therefore not only in heat and coldness, and in softness and hardness, but also in all the other differences of the condition of the whole body, concerning which the matter of thinness and thickness has now been discussed, but concerning the others let us now speak.",

      "claude_translation": "But in cases where the skin is moist and precisely soft, like freshly curdled cheese, the passages of what has fallen through do not remain open, since the parts of it that were previously separated unite with one another again; but in cases where it is already hard, similar to solidified cheese, it is perforated by the force of what exits, but being unable to unite because of dryness, it keeps the pores always open, and they become more fistulous from the continuous impacts of what flows through. Now if what flows through is either vapor or pure liquid, the vapor has a swift and unimpeded passage; but the liquid is often held back in the smaller pores, and is forced to flow back inward into the depth. But if the exhalation is like soot and thick and earthy, there is danger that it, often wedged in the narrow passages, can neither easily return inward anymore nor be evacuated. Therefore another such exhalation rising up from the depth strikes it and pushes it forward, and this one again by another, and that one by yet another. And imagine many sooty exhalations thus wedged upon one another, in time becoming intertwined and joined together, and forming one body of such a kind as soot is externally, except that, insofar as it has been compressed, to that extent it has also been precisely compacted, having been felted by the narrowness of the passage. But when such a body blocks the entire pore, being from that point violently struck by waste products similar to itself that have no exit, it is pushed forward all together in this way, so that it is also forced to protrude from the skin, having now become strap-like. Its part wedged in the pore resembles a kind of root of grass or a plant, while the part already projecting from the skin is like the plant itself. Hair is black when, the exhalation having been burned up by the strength of heat, the waste product becomes perfect soot; but it is blonde when it is less thoroughly roasted. For then what is wedged is the muddy waste product of yellow bile, not black bile. White hair is the offspring of phlegm. Red hair, just as it is intermediate in color between blonde and white, so too in origin it is intermediate between phlegmatic and bilious sediment. Curly hairs occur either because of the dryness of the mixture or because of the pore in which they are rooted: because of dryness in a manner similar to straps that have been excessively dried by fire. And yet why need we mention straps, when we see the hairs themselves, if they approach fire, immediately becoming twisted? Thus all Ethiopians are curly-haired in this way. But according to the nature of the pores in which they are rooted, it happens as follows. Often the exhalation, being unable to travel straight because of weakness, in whatever manner it twists itself, has also shaped the pore in this way. Sometimes the exhalation is strong, but being prevented from traveling straight by the nature of the skin, which is harder than appropriate, it turns to the side, just as indeed one can see externally, not only vapor or smoke, but even flames themselves, when they are blocked from upward movement, splitting obliquely to either side. Thus also the exhalation from the body, when it is blocked at some point and prevented from traveling outward, makes an oblique passage under the skin, until having accumulated over a longer time it forces its way and breathes out to the exterior. Sometimes when both conditions occur together—both the first exhalation that created the pore being weak and the skin being dry—the obliqueness occurs in the roots of the hairs. And whatever form they are molded into at the rooting, it is reasonable that they remain such forever. For indeed it is not possible to straighten any other hard and dry body without first softening it. This then is the generation of hairs. Next it would be appropriate to speak of the causes of all the characteristics that belong to the mixtures [temperaments] in the differences of hairs according to age and region and nature of body. Now Egyptians, Arabs, Indians, and every nation inhabiting a hot and dry region have hairs that are black and slow-growing and dry and curly and brittle.",

For one ought not to make conjectures so simply, but it would have been better to make distinctions first, that the body of human beings, in some cases is mixed uniformly throughout, but in some cases, and these are not few, is disposed unevenly. For some of their parts are more moist than what is moderate and appropriate, others are colder, others drier, others hotter, and still others are completely well-tempered and moderate. One must pay attention especially to this when examining the mixture of a body. For if the whole is uniformly well-proportioned and preserves all the symmetries of the parts in relation to one another in length and breadth and depth, such a body could be mixed uniformly throughout. But if some body has a very large chest and neck and shoulders, but the parts at the loins are thin and small, and the legs are slender and dry, how could this be similarly disposed in all its parts? Nor indeed, if the legs are thick and the parts at the loins broad, but it has a narrow chest, would this either be uniformly mixed in its parts. Other bodies have a very large head, others a small one, like sparrows. And as for the legs, some are bow-legged, others knock-kneed, and as for the extremities of the limbs, some are thin, others thick. And the chest in some, as was said before, is straight, but in some so narrow, like a plank, whom they indeed call \"plank-like.\" But when the parts at their shoulder blades are also completely fleshless and bare and protruding like wings, such constitutions are called \"wing-like\" by physicians; but to what degree of defect they have come, when the chest has lost almost all the interior space in which the lung and heart are positioned, is clear to everyone. There are countless other obvious conditions of the parts of the body, whenever, having deviated from the natural proportion into some uneven bad mixture, it immediately changes while being conceived [in the womb]. Therefore, in the case of such people, one must not draw conclusions about the whole from a single part. For not even those who attempt to practice physiognomy make simple pronouncements about everyone, but they too have been taught by experience. For if someone is sufficiently hairy on the chest, they declare him spirited; but if he is such on the thighs, they declare him lustful; they do not, however, add the cause yet. For not even when they say that the chest resembles a lion's, but the thighs a goat's, have they discovered the primary cause. For the argument seeks to discover why the lion is spirited, but the goat lustful. For up to this point they have stated what happens, but they have omitted its cause.",

      "claude_translation": "But the natural philosopher, just as with all other things, so too attempts to discover the causes of these matters. For because not only the lion and the goat, but also very many of the other animals are disposed unevenly with respect to the mixtures [kraseis] of their parts, for this reason different animals are readily suited to different activities. Now concerning these matters, Aristotle has spoken well at great length. But what is useful for present purposes is already apparent: that one must examine the mixtures of human beings, investigating each of the parts by itself, and not suppose that if someone has a hairy chest, the whole body of this person necessarily is hotter and drier; rather, the heat is greatest in the heart, which is why such a person is also spirited [thymic]; but it is possible sometimes for this very reason that not all of their body is similarly hot and dry, because respiration occurred there most abundantly, and the heat was evacuated to the surrounding air. For if the mixture of the whole body is uniform, immediately for these people the entire chest itself would be very broad, and the veins wide, and the arteries both large and pulsing very greatly and vigorously, and there would be much hair over the whole body, and the hairs of the head would be very well-grown and black and curly in the first age [youth], but as time advances baldness will follow. And indeed the body of such people, whenever they have a uniform mixture, will be entirely sinewy, well-articulated, and muscular, and the skin harder and darker, just as also hairier. And likewise if the opposite conditions occur regarding the chest, when the mixture is uniform throughout the whole body—that is, when all the parts have become moister and colder—their chest will be narrow and hairless, just as indeed the whole body will be bare of hair, and the skin soft and white, and the hair reddish, especially in youth, and they do not become bald in old age; and immediately they are also cowardly, timid, and hesitant, having small and indistinct veins, and fatty, and weak in sinews and muscles, and their limbs poorly articulated, and they become bow-legged. However, when the mixture of the parts has been made different, it is no longer possible to make a judgment about the whole body from one of them alone, but it is better to proceed to each part and examine how the stomach is disposed with respect to mixture, and how the lung, and how the brain, and each of the others individually and by itself. Now these things one must recognize from their functions; for it is not possible to discover their mixture either by touching with the sense of touch or by observing with the eyes. But one must also consider the conditions of the parts that contain them, of all of which the skin is on the outside, which in our temperate dwelling place indicates the nature of the underlying parts—not of all of them without qualification, but of those that are similarly disposed in their mixtures to the skin. But in the regions under the northern constellations and under the south, since in the former the heat has been driven into the depths, being overcome by the external cold of the surrounding air, while in the latter it has come forth to the skin, being drawn out by the warmth of the surrounding air, it is not possible to know clearly from the condition of the skin about the mixture of the internal parts. For the mixture of the body is uneven in regions with bad climates [dyskratoi], since the external parts and the internal ones are not disposed in the same way.",

Indeed, this too has been most finely distinguished by Aristotle in many cases; and one must attend to it, if to anything, and examine in each body whether it is warm by its own heat or by an acquired [heat]. For all things that are putrefying are warm by an acquired heat but cold by their own. And the bodies of those dwelling in the southern region are warm by an acquired heat but cold by their own. Among us too, in winter the natural [innate] heat is greater, while the acquired is less; but in summer the acquired is greater, the congenital [innate] less. All these things, at any rate, must be distinguished by the person who is going to diagnose temperament [krasis, the mixture of qualities] correctly.

Similarly also, when beef and all foods that are difficult to digest are being well digested, the heat is excessive; but the heat is weak when these foods are not being digested, but rock fish or something of that sort is being digested. One must examine again at this point whether the symptom occurs in the stomach not because of some humor flowing down from elsewhere. For in some people phlegm flows down from the head into the stomach, while in others yellow bile flows down from the liver, though this is rare and happens to very few people. But in very many people phlegm descends from the head, and especially in Rome and in similarly damp regions. But indeed one must also pay attention to what is rare, and not treat anything as a side matter, nor neglect it. For I myself know certain people who are quite phlegmatic in whom a great deal of yellow bile accumulates in the stomach, which they needed to vomit up by drinking water or wine before meals. But if they ever touched food before vomiting, they both corrupted it and suffered headaches, and some people thought these men were bilious by nature.

      "openai_translation": "But in those cases where it is greater, the stomach in the course of a day fills up with no small amount of bile, which they both need to vomit up before eating, and they are harmed if they keep it down. In those, however, whose passage is altogether simple [i.e., unobstructed], all the bile flows down into the empty stomach [nēstis]. How, then, should one diagnose them? For I certainly do not think we should cut human beings open while alive. First, by the overall temperament [krasis] of the body, as was said a little earlier; second, by what they discharge downward. For in Eudemus, pure bilious matter was being continuously evacuated through the stomach, both because he was accumulating much bile, and because none of it was reaching the upper belly [anō koilia]. But in others whose habit is phlegmatic, though they vomit bile, the bilious element is least separated out; for only a little of the yellow bile [xanthē cholē] is produced in them, and most of it arrives in the upper belly. Third, in addition to what has been said, there is a form of signs in the very excretions themselves. For in those whose bilious residue is generated in the stomach, it appears leek-green [praso-eides]; but it is precisely yellow, or at any rate pale, in those for whom it comes up from the liver. And for those in whom this leek-green matter is generated in the stomach, the solid food they have eaten should by all means be something other than bread and pork, or anything of that sort akin to it, but rather something warmer, and among what necessity allows, not “juicy” [i.e., not rich in fluid, not easily yielding sap; ouk euchymon]. But those in whom it arrives there from the liver vomit yellow or pale matter, even if the food taken is extremely “juicy,” even if it is perfectly well cooked. Indeed, those who have digested most exactly vomit the yellow matters more, and much more still if they have fasted beyond that. The leek-green matters are generated only in those who have digested badly in the belly. Moreover, anxieties, fits of anger, griefs, toils, exercises, sleeplessness, fastings, and privations all heap up for such people a greater amount of the juice of yellow bile, because they also produce more of it in the liver. So these signs are exact; and in addition, when the dryness and burning character of the heat about the stomach tends toward the bilious, breads and pork and beef will be better cooked (more suitable) than rock-fish. But if it is flowing down from the liver, there will not be even the slightest difference in digestion despite the substitution of foods. In these points, then, the condition arising from some other cause has been distinguished from that arising from temperament. In the same way, if phlegm flowing from the head down to the stomach becomes the cause of sour belchings [oxyregmiai], here too one must separate it, by similar methods, from an affection belonging properly to the stomach. And so also with headaches—whether they are due to the head’s own dyscrasia [bad mixture/temperament], or due to residues from the stomach. Indeed, it is better to examine the brain itself, as to what kind of temperament it has, rather than from the disposition of the whole body. And the examination of its temperament in itself is by greying [poliosis], and by catarrhs [katarrhoi], coughs, coryzas [head colds], and an abundance of spittle; for all these show that it is by nature colder and wetter. Even more so, if on ordinary provocations it comes into such conditions. Balding [phalakrōsis] is due to dryness, while the production of dark and abundant hair is a sign of a well-tempered brain. One must always consider temperament in this way, examining each part individually, and not dare to pronounce about everything from one sign alone, as some have done—saying that the snub-nosed are moist, the hook-nosed dry, and those whose eyes are small dry, but those whose eyes are large moist. This, then, is even contradicted among themselves. For some, having assumed that the eyes are among the moist parts, suppose that in those whom they find to have larger eyes, moist temperament prevails. Others say that, when the strength of the heat at the first formation breathed out more abundantly and in greater quantity, not only the eyes, but also the mouth and all the other pores became larger—whence it is a sign not of moisture but of heat.",

      "claude_translation": "But in those cases where it is greater, in these the stomach fills up daily with no small amount of bile, which they need to vomit before meals, and they are harmed if they retain it. But in those for whom the passage is entirely simple, all the bile flows down into the jejunum [fasting intestine] for these people. How then should one diagnose them? For I certainly do not think it right to dissect living human beings. First, by the whole mixture [temperament] of the body, according to what was said a little earlier, and second, by what passes downward. For unmixed bilious matter was continually evacuated through the bowels in Eudemus's case, because he also accumulated much bile, and none of it reached the upper cavity [stomach]. But for the others, whose constitution is phlegmatic but who vomit bile, bilious matter is least evacuated through the bowels; for both little yellow bile is generated in them, and most of it reaches the upper cavity. Third, in addition to what has been said, there is a type of distinguishing sign in the very things that are evacuated. For in those for whom the bilious residue is generated in the stomach, it appears leek-green; but it is precisely yellow, or at any rate pale, in those for whom it passes down from the liver. And for those in whom this leek-green matter is generated in the stomach, the food eaten by them must certainly not be bread or pork, or anything similar of this sort, but rather something hotter, and necessarily not producing good humors. But for those to whom it comes from the liver into it [the stomach], yellow or pale matter is vomited, even if the food taken is most productive of good humors and even if it has been perfectly digested. And yellow matter is vomited more by those who have digested perfectly, and much more still by those who have fasted for a longer time. But leek-green matter is generated only in those who have digested poorly in the cavity [stomach]. And indeed worries, angers, griefs, labors, exercises, sleeplessness, fasting, and deprivations accumulate more of the humor of yellow bile in these people, because they also generate more in the liver. These then are accurate distinguishing signs, and in addition to these, still further, since the conversion to the bilious follows from the dry and fiery quality of the heat in the stomach, breads and pork and beef will be digested better than rock fish. But if it flows down from the liver, there will be not even one difference in digestion according to the variation of foods. In these matters, then, what occurs through some other cause and not through the mixture [temperament] has been distinguished. And in the same manner, if phlegm flowing down from the head onto the stomach should become a cause of acid regurgitation, one must here too separate it from the stomach's own affection by similar methods. And likewise also headaches, either through its own bad mixture [temperament] or through the residues of the stomach. And indeed it is better to examine the brain by itself, of what mixture it is, not from the condition of the whole body. But the examination of it by itself, of what mixture it is, consists of graying of hair, and catarrhs, and coughs, and head colds, and abundance of saliva. For all these things show that it is colder and more moist. And even more so, if it comes into such conditions from ordinary causes. But baldness occurs from dryness, and the generation of black and abundant hair is a sign of good mixture of the brain. In this manner, then, one must always examine concerning mixture [temperament], investigating each part individually, and not dare to pronounce about all things from one sign, as some have done, saying that those with snub noses are moist, and those with hooked noses are dry, and those whose eyes are small are dry, and those whose eyes are large are moist. Now on this point they have even contradicted themselves. For some, having assumed that the eyes are among the moist parts, suppose that in whomever they find them larger, moistness of mixture prevails in these people. But some say that by the strength of the heat in the first formation [embryonic development] having expanded more collectively and abundantly, not only the eyes but also the mouth and all the other passages became larger, whence this is a sign not of moistness but of heat.",

In those, however, for whom the passage is completely straight, all the bile flows down into the small intestine [jejunum] during fasting. How, then, should one distinguish between them? For I certainly do not think it right to dissect living human beings. First, by the overall constitution [krasis] of the body, as was said a little earlier, and second, by what passes downwards. For in the case of Eudemus, unmixed bilious matter was continuously passed downwards from the stomach, because he both accumulated a great deal of bile and none of it reached his upper belly [stomach]. But in others, whose constitution [hexis] is phlegmatic but who vomit bile, very little bilious matter is passed in the stool; for little yellow bile is produced in them, and most of it reaches the upper belly [stomach].\n\nA third kind of sign, in addition to those mentioned, is in the evacuated substances themselves. In those in whom the bilious superfluity is produced in the stomach, it appears leek-green; but it is precisely yellow, or at any rate pale, in those in whom it comes down from the liver. And in those in whom this leek-green substance is produced in the stomach, the food they have eaten must necessarily be not bread or pork, or anything similar, but something hotter and, of necessity, not of good humor. But in those in whom it arrives in the stomach from the liver, the vomit will be yellow or pale, even if the food taken was of the best humor and even if it was perfectly digested. And yellow substances are vomited more by those who have digested perfectly, and much more still by those who have fasted for a longer time on top of that. But leek-green substances are produced in the belly only in those who have digested poorly.\n\nFurthermore, worries, fits of anger, griefs, toils, exercises, sleepless nights, periods of fasting, and states of want all cause a greater amount of the yellow bile humor to collect in these people, because they also produce more of it in the liver. These signs, then, are precise. And in addition to these, another: since the transformation [of food] into a bilious substance is a consequence of the heat in the stomach being arid and fiery, breads and the meat of pigs and oxen will be better digested than rock-fish. But if the bile were to flow down from the liver, there will be no difference in digestion corresponding to the change in foods. By these means, then, a condition arising from some other cause and not from the constitution [krasis] has been distinguished.\n\nIn the same way, if phlegm flowing down from the head to the stomach should become the cause of sour belching, one must here too, according to similar methods, separate this from a pathology proper to the stomach itself. And so too with headaches, whether they arise from the head’s own imbalance [dyskrasia] or from superfluities in the stomach. And indeed, it is better to investigate the brain by itself to see what sort of constitution it has, and not from the disposition of the whole body. The investigation of its own particular constitution involves observing the graying of hair, catarrhs, coughs, head-colds, and abundance of saliva. For all these things indicate that it is colder and moister. This is even",

And in a second way, because they make no mention of the formative power in nature, which is skilled and fashions the parts in accordance with the character of the soul. For indeed Aristotle raised the question about this power, whether it might perhaps belong to some more divine principle, and not operate according to hot and cold, and dry and wet. Therefore, it does not seem to me that those who pronounce so rashly on the greatest matters act correctly, attributing formation to the qualities alone.

      "openai_translation": "But if the whole is blended uniformly, it is reasonable that, just as the skin is, so too each of the other parts should be of the same sort; but if it is blended unevenly, no longer so. For in shellfish, at any rate, the whole body is exceedingly moist, while the skin is exceedingly dry. Their shell, in fact, is to them what the skin is to us. And the very name comes from this, since all such animals are called “shell-skinned” [ostrakodermoi], from the skin’s being akin to a shell. Likewise the “soft-shelled” creatures, such as lobsters, prawns, and crabs, have a dry skin but an entirely moist temperament [krasis] otherwise. And this very fact is often the cause of moisture in their flesh, namely that their nature lays all that is dry and earthy upon the skin. So one must not, because this [outer part] is dry in shellfish, immediately assume that the flesh is also dry, nor, because it is flaccid and mucous, at once suppose the skin is of that sort. It is right that each of the parts be judged from itself.\n\nThese, then, are the mistakes of those who have left us treatises on mixtures [kraiseis]; and in addition, they do not remember what Hippocrates most rightly advised—that one must examine the changes, from what states into what states they come about. For often the present signs belong to the prior mixture, not to the one the body now has. Suppose, for instance, someone at sixty years of age is quite hirsute: this is not because he is now hot and dry, but because he was so previously, and the hairs generated then persist, just as in summer the plants that sprouted in spring often persist. In some people, over time and little by little, it happens that they are rid of that excessive hairiness, as the hairs fall out on account of extreme dryness; in others they remain for a very long time, namely those whose hairs have neither dried out sufficiently as time advances nor failed to acquire a strong first growth—like plants well rooted in the ground. Therefore, if someone is quite hirsute, let us not at once suppose him to be melancholic, but if he is in his prime, not yet such; if he is past his prime, already melancholic; and if he is old, no longer. For melancholic mixtures arise from the charring together [synkausis] of the blood. Yet when this condition begins, it does not at once become fully and completely baked. A hot and dry person will soon enough be hirsute, to be sure—if we remember the earlier arguments—but not immediately melancholic. For the densification of the skin, by blocking the outlets for the thicker residues [perittōmata], forces them to be scorched together in cases of intensely hot mixtures, so that the residue which produces the hairs already has the character it will later come to have in the vessels, as time goes on.\n\nThese points, then, earlier writers have neglected, and, beyond these, they also go wrong whenever they draw conclusions about mixtures from the nature of the residues without distinction. They suppose that the mixtures of the parts correspond proportionally to the nature of the residues. But this is not entirely true: it can happen that phlegmatic residues accumulate while the part is not moist, but necessarily cold—though not necessarily moist; it can, in fact, be dry. The source of their error is easy to spot: they did not consider that phlegm is produced from foods, and not from our body itself. So there is nothing surprising if, when the body fails at times to master the foods that have been taken in—foods which may happen to be of a moist nature—the residue turns out similar to them. Let them not assume, then, that, just as the body is dry, the residue must also be dry. For if someone from the very beginning happened to be drier and colder in mixture, such a person is not melancholic, but phlegmatic in respect of his residues; whereas if he became dry and cold through a change, such a person is of necessity already at once melancholic—such as one who was previously hot and dry through the charring of the blood and generated a very great quantity of black bile. This is the person who, in addition to being dry and cold, is at once melancholic. But if a man were from the start cold and dry, the condition of his body is white and soft and scant of hair, without veins and without joints [i.e., with poor vascularity and weak articulation], thin, and cold to the touch; and the disposition of his soul is unbold, timid, and despondent—yet his residues are not melancholic. All these points, then, most physicians miss because they abandon proper signs of what belongs [to the parts themselves] and pass over, not uniformly but only “for the most part,” to incidental features. For this reason they also think that whatever heats must necessarily dry. I know that by adding this, as it were a crown and head to the whole argument, I am now bringing the second book to a close. For whenever they apply warm water repeatedly to inflamed parts, and then see the moisture evacuated from them, they suppose it to be manifestly shown that everything is dried by heating—not only when accompanied by dryness, but even when accompanied by moisture. But it is not the same thing to evacuate moisture that has been infiltrated into certain places, and to make the intrinsic mixture drier.",

      "claude_translation": "But if the whole is blended uniformly, it is reasonable that each of the other parts should be of the same sort as the skin; but if non-uniformly, no longer. For instance, in the case of oysters, the whole body is very moist, but the skin is very dry. For the shell is to them what the skin is to us. And the name itself comes from this, all such animals having been named \"shell-skinned\" [ostracoderms], from the fact that their skin is similar to a shell. And the soft-shelled creatures, such as lobsters, crayfish, and crabs, have dry skin, but all the rest of their mixture is moist. And this very thing is often the cause for animals of the moisture in their flesh, because nature deposits all that is dry and earthy in them toward the skin. Therefore, one should not suppose that, just because this is dry in oysters, the flesh is immediately also dry, nor that, because it is flabby and mucous, one should assume that the skin is also of this sort. For it is right that each of the parts be recognized from itself. These things, then, are errors made by those who have left us treatises on mixtures [temperaments]; and furthermore, in addition to these, that they do not even remember what was most correctly advised by Hippocrates, that one must examine the changes, from what sorts of things into what sorts they occur. For often the present signs are of the former mixture, not of the one now belonging to the body. For suppose someone who has reached sixty years of age is quite hairy; this is not because he is now hot and dry, but because he was previously of such a nature, and the hairs generated then persist, just as in summer the plants that sprouted in spring often remain. For in some cases it happened over time and gradually that they were freed from that excessive hairiness, the hairs falling out from extreme dryness; but in some they persist for a very long time, in those who neither become sufficiently dried out as time advances, and whose hairs made their first growth strong, like plants firmly rooted in the earth. Therefore, if someone is quite hairy, let us not immediately think that this person is melancholic, but if he is in his prime, not yet such; but if past his prime, already melancholic; but if old, no longer. For melancholic mixtures arise from the burning up of blood. However, when this begins to happen, it is not immediately completely roasted. But the hot and dry person will quite quickly become hairy, if indeed we remember the earlier arguments, but not immediately melancholic. For the densification of the skin, blocking the passage of the thicker waste products, compels them to be burned up in extremely hot mixtures, so that the waste product that grows the hairs is already of such a nature for them as it will be in the blood vessels when time has advanced. And these things too have been neglected by earlier writers, and furthermore, in addition to these, when they make pronouncements about mixtures indiscriminately from the nature of the waste products. For they believe that the mixtures of the parts correspond proportionally to the nature of the waste products. But this is not entirely true, but it is possible sometimes for phlegmatic waste products to accumulate, yet the part not to be moist, but cold necessarily, though not necessarily moist; for it is possible for it to be dry. And what deceived them is easily detected. For they did not understand that phlegm comes from foods, and not from our body itself. Therefore it is no wonder if the body, not having at some time mastered the foods that were brought in, which happen to be moist in nature, will produce a waste product similar to them. Therefore, let them not suppose that, just as the body is dry, so too the waste product must be dry. For if someone was from the beginning drier and colder in mixture, such a person is not melancholic, but phlegmatic in his waste products. But if he became dry and cold from a change, such a person is necessarily immediately also melancholic; for instance, if someone who was previously hot and dry generated a great deal of black bile from the burning up of blood. This person, then, is the one who, in addition to being dry and cold, is immediately also melancholic. But if he were cold and dry from the beginning, the condition of his body is white and soft and hairless, without visible veins and joints and thin and cold to the touch, and the character of his soul is unventuresome and cowardly and despondent, yet the waste products are not melancholic. All these things, then, are errors made by most physicians from departing from the proper signs and moving to those that are accidental, not always but for the most part. For this reason they also think that what heats necessarily dries. For I have decided, adding this as a sort of flourish and conclusion to the entire argument, to bring the second book to an end now. At any rate, when they pour hot water each time on inflamed parts, and then see the moisture being evacuated from them, they think it is clearly demonstrated that drying occurs in every case from heating, not only if it is with dryness, but even if it is with moisture. But it is not the same thing either to evacuate some moisture dispersed in certain regions, or to make the proper mixture drier.",

      "openai_translation": "For just as even fire does not increase until the wood, having been conquered by it, is transformed—and this of necessity occurs in a certain time—so in the same way the heat within living creatures does not increase, unless first the drugs themselves are transformed by it. For one is heated in one way when warmed by a fire or in the sun, and in another way when heated by each of the aforesaid drugs. The former are hot in actuality [energeia], but none of the drugs is so. Therefore they are not able to heat us before becoming such in actuality; and what is actual they receive from ourselves, just as dry reeds receive it from the fire. Thus too all wood is cold by nature, yet the drier and smaller kinds are easily transformed into fire, whereas the wetter and larger require more time. There is nothing strange, then, if the drugs must first be crushed into small and fine particles, and secondly, if they must associate for a certain time, even a very short one, with our bodies, in order to become hot. But you, if you expect them already to become hot without first crushing them or warming them, seem to me to have forgotten what “hot in potential” [dynamis] means. You test them, then, as if they were hot in actuality.\n\nNor, indeed, is it surprising if they must first be warmed, so that they may warm in return. For this too happens in the case of wood. The flame, when it is on the point of going out, both preserves and increases itself by first warming the wood with that very flame. It is therefore not at all unlikely that the heat in living creatures should employ such drugs as a kind of nourishment, as fire does wood. For that is in fact what is observed to happen. But if you apply any one of them, however carefully made fine, to a body that has been chilled, it is not warmed at all. And for this reason we rub the chilled parts at length with such drugs, at once kindling heat by the friction and at the same time making rarefied what had previously been compacted by the cold, so that the drug may enter within and, by consorting with the innate heat of the living creature, be transformed and become hot. For if even a very tiny part of it were to acquire heat in actuality, it would thus diffuse through the whole by continuity, as if you were to touch the tip of a torch with a small spark: for the fire spreads readily through the whole of it, needing the spark no longer.\n\nEach of the things that are hot in potential does not yet have the hot surpassing the cold in its nature, but is already near to surpassing, so that it needs only a slight assistance from outside in order to prevail. Sometimes rubbing is sufficient to provide this, at other times either fire or the touch of some naturally hot body. It is therefore no marvel to say why some drugs, as soon as they touch our body, are by nature able to warm it in return, while others do this after a longer time. For of the things brought near to fire, some are immediately kindled—like the wick, the slender torch, pitch, and dry reed—while others are not overcome unless they remain near for a long time, like green wood.",

      "claude_translation": "For just as fire does not grow until the wood, having been overcome by it, is transformed—and this certainly happens in some period of time—in the same way neither does the heat in animals, unless the drugs are first transformed by that very heat itself. For a person who is warmed by sitting near a fire or in the sun is heated in one manner, but one who is heated by each of the aforementioned drugs is heated in another manner. For those things are actually hot, but none of the drugs are. Therefore they cannot heat us until they become such things actually, and they receive their actuality from us ourselves, just as dry reeds do from fire. So too all wood is cold according to its own nature, but that which is drier and smaller is easily transformed into fire, while that which is moister and larger requires more time. Therefore it is not at all surprising if drugs also need first to be broken down into small and fine particles, and second to be in contact with our bodies for some time, even if very brief, in order to become hot. But if you, without having broken them down or heated them first, expect them to be hot already, you seem to me to have forgotten what \"potentially hot\" means. Thus you are testing them as if they were actually hot. And yet it is not surprising either if they need to be heated first in order to heat in return. For this happens also according to the analogy of wood. At any rate, wood both preserves and increases a dying flame, having first been heated by that very flame. Therefore it is not at all unreasonable that the heat in animals also uses such drugs as a kind of nourishment, just as fire uses wood. For indeed this is what appears to happen. But if you sprinkle any of them on a chilled body, having made it exceedingly fine, it is not heated at all. And for this reason we rub chilled parts extensively with such drugs, at the same time kindling heat by the rubbing, and at the same time making porous what has previously been condensed by the cold, so that the drug may penetrate within and, being in contact with the innate heat of the animal, may be transformed and heated. For even if some very small portion of it should acquire heat actually, it thus spreads throughout the whole by continuity, just as if you should light the tip of a torch from a small spark; for the fire easily spreads over all of this too, no longer needing the spark at all. Therefore each of the potentially hot things does not yet have the hot predominating over the cold in its nature, but is already near to predominating, so that it needs only slight assistance from outside in order to prevail. And sometimes rubbing is sufficient to provide this for it, and sometimes either fire or contact with one of the naturally hot bodies. Therefore it is not at all difficult to explain why some things are naturally able to heat our body in return immediately upon touching it, while others do this over a longer time. For indeed even among things that approach fire, some are ignited immediately, such as a lamp wick, a thin torch, pitch, and dry reed, while others, unless they approach for a long time, are not overcome, such as green wood.",

Each animal is nourished by foods appropriate to itself; and the appropriate food for each is whatever is able to be assimilated to the body being nourished. It is necessary, then, that the entire substance of what nourishes should possess with the whole nature of what is nourished a certain community and likeness, though here too there is by all means no small difference present according to more and less. For some things are more suitable and similar, others less; and so, in their working-up [pepsis: digestion], some require a stronger and more prolonged process, others a weaker and shorter one. Thus bird-flesh needs less, pork more, and beef still more. Wine requires the least change for assimilation; hence it both nourishes and restores vigor most quickly. Nevertheless, even wine must have contact with the organs of digestion—the stomach, the liver, and the veins—in which, once it has been pre-processed, it can already nourish the body; before it meets with this transformation in those parts, it cannot possibly become an animal’s food, even if applied from outside to the body the whole day and night. Much less could bread applied externally, or beet, or barley-cake, nourish. Therefore, whatever becomes thoroughly similar in every respect is food; all the rest in general are called drugs. And even among these, the nature is twofold. For either, remaining as it was when taken in, it overpowers and alters the body—as the body does to aliments—and these are certainly drugs that are poisons and destructive of the animal’s nature; or else, after taking from the body the beginning of a change, it thereupon putrefies and is ruined, and thereafter co-ruins and putrefies the body. These too are poisons. There is, third, among them a kind of drugs which warm the body in reaction, yet do no harm. And a fourth kind, which, though they both act and are acted upon, are overcome in time and become completely assimilated. It so happens that these are at once drugs and foods. Nor is it at all surprising if some things, taking a slight point of departure, achieve a very great deviation from their former nature. Indeed, many such cases are seen also among things outside. For in Mysia in Asia a house once burned down in the following way. Pigeon dung had been piled up, already putrefied, warmed, sending up vapor, and warm enough to the touch. Near it—close enough even to be touched—was a little window with boards newly smeared with much resin. In the middle of summer a fierce sun, striking upon it, set fire to the resin and the boards; from there other doors and windows near at hand, just recently plastered with resin, readily caught the fire and sent it up to the roof. And once the flame took hold of that, it quickly spread through the whole house. In somewhat this way, I suppose, they say that Archimedes, by means of burning mirrors [pyreia: burning mirrors/lenses], set the enemy triremes ablaze.",

Each of the animals is nourished by its proper foods; and proper food for each is everything that can be assimilated to the body being nourished. It is necessary, therefore, that the entire substance of what nourishes should possess a certain communion and similarity with the entire nature of what is being nourished, there being certainly no small difference existing in these matters according to the more and the less. For some things are more proper and similar, others less so, with the result that some require stronger and more prolonged processing, while others require weaker and briefer processing. Thus bird meat requires less, pork more, and beef still more. Wine requires the least transformation for assimilation, which is why it also nourishes and strengthens most quickly. Nevertheless, even wine must come into contact with the digestive organs—the stomach, liver, and veins—in which, having been processed beforehand, it can then nourish the body; but before it undergoes the transformation in these organs, it cannot become nourishment for an animal, even if it were applied externally to the body for an entire day and night. Much more so is it impossible for bread applied externally, or beet, or barley-cake to nourish. Therefore, things that are assimilated in every way are foods; but all other things are called drugs [pharmaka]. The nature of these is also twofold. For either, remaining as they were when taken in, they overcome and transform the body in the same way that the body transforms foods—and these are certainly drugs that are poisonous and destructive to the nature of the animal—or, having received the beginning of transformation from the body, they then putrefy and are corrupted, and thereafter they corrupt and putrefy the body along with themselves. These too are poisons. But there is a third class of drugs in addition to these: those that warm the body but produce no harm. And a fourth: those that both act and are acted upon, but are overcome in time and completely assimilated. It happens that these are both drugs and foods at the same time. It is not surprising if some things, having received a small stimulus, undergo the greatest deviation from their original nature. At any rate, many such things are observed even among external objects. For example, in Mysia in Asia, a house was once burned in the following manner. Pigeon dung had been stored away, already putrefied and heated and sending up vapor, and quite hot to the touch. Near this, so close as actually to touch it, was a window having wooden frames recently coated with a great deal of resin. When the fierce sun of midsummer struck it, it ignited both the resin and the wood. And from there, certain other doors and windows nearby that had recently been coated with resin easily caught the fire and extended it up to the roof. Once the flame seized upon that, it quickly spread throughout the entire house. In some such way, I believe, they say that Archimedes also burned the enemy's triremes by means of burning-mirrors [pyria].",

      "claude_translation": "For just as suitable nourishments for fire increase the fire, so too whatever nourishment happens to be proper and natural for bodies that are hot by nature will both strengthen them continually and increase their innate heat. And this is common to all nourishment. But wine has as its own distinctive property the speed of its transformation, like a torch, a lamp-wick, pitch, and tow. And indeed, keeping to the analogy of fire, we shall recall in turn wet wood, which is itself also nourishment for fire, but not immediately, nor from the instant it is applied. And for this reason, when much of it is thrown upon the fire, it both conceals the flame and, especially if the flame is weak and small, brings danger of extinction. Thus also in animals, whatever foods require time in order to be completely assimilated and nourish the body appear to bring cold rather than warmth in the immediate moment. Nevertheless, these too produce warmth over time, similarly to other foods, provided only that they succeed in nourishing the body. For all nourishment according to its own nature increases the heat of the animal. But if it should be swallowed as nourishment, yet not be mastered [i.e., digested], this would be what was said by Hippocrates: it would be nourishment in name, but not in function. For since nourishment is spoken of in three ways, as he himself taught when he said this: \"Nourishment is that which nourishes, nourishment is that which is like nourishment, and that which is about to be [nourishment]\"—that which is already nourishing, and being assimilated, and no longer potential, is properly called nourishment and indeed in all cases warms the body being nourished; but neither of the other two, because they are not properly nourishments, but one is like nourishment, and the other because it is going to become such. Therefore wine itself also does not always warm the animal, just as oil does not always kindle the flame, although it is indeed the most suitable nourishment for fire. But if you pour oil suddenly and in large quantity upon a weak and small flame, you will smother it and completely extinguish it rather than increase it. Thus also wine, whenever it is drunk in such quantity that it cannot be mastered [digested], is so far from warming the animal that it even generates colder conditions.",

Yet this agrees with what was laid down from the beginning. For at the same time, it is because they are changed and altered both when being digested in the stomach and when being converted to blood in the veins; and in addition to this, also because they do not remain in one place, but are divided into many parts being carried everywhere; and besides this, because they are mixed both with many humors and with the foods taken together with them; and still further in addition to this, because both their digestion and their separation occur quickly, so that what is suitable is assimilated, while what is superfluous and acrid in them is excreted through the bowels and at the same time through urine and sweat—for all these reasons, what ulcerates from outside does not ulcerate when eaten. And yet even if any one whatsoever of the things mentioned belonged to them, it would surely be sufficient to keep external parts unharmed—for instance, if it so happened, the changing first of all. For if the mustard does not remain such as it was when taken from outside, it is clear that you will not maintain that its power remains either. And if it is also separated and purified, much more so indeed. But even the not lingering in one place was sufficient. For it appears unable to do anything even to the skin without considerable time. But also the mixing with many other foods is itself no small matter. You would recognize this if you were to take it alone apart from other foods, how much distress and biting it brings to the stomach.

And yet this agrees with the principles laid down at the outset: first, because these things are transformed and altered, being digested in the stomach, and when in the veins they are turned into blood; in addition, because they do not remain in a single place, but are divided into many parts as they are carried everywhere; further, because they are mixed both with many juices [χυμοί, bodily fluids] and with the foods taken together with them; and further still, because both their digestion and their separation occur quickly—so that the proper part is assimilated, while what in them is superfluous and acrid is excreted through the bowel and also through urine and sweat. For all these reasons, what produces ulceration from without does not ulcerate when eaten.\n\nIndeed, even if any one of the things just mentioned were present, it would surely be enough to keep the outer parts unharmed—for instance, to begin with, the fact that it changes. For if the mustard does not remain such as it was when taken externally, it is clear you would not suppose its power remains either. And if it is also separated out and purified, so much the more. It would also suffice that it does not linger in one place. For it appears that even on the skin it cannot effect anything without a considerable time. Moreover, the fact that it is mixed with many other foods is no small matter either. You would realize this, if you were to administer it by itself, apart from other foods, how much distress and biting it brings upon the stomach. And moreover, even if you were to mix it with many sweet juices and apply it to the skin, it would accomplish nothing harmful.",

For it is altered in digestion, and it is separated out, and it is purified, and it is mixed with many other things, and it is portioned out in many ways, and it is carried everywhere, and it lingers in none of the parts. And that, if it had remained sharp [i.e., caustic], it would certainly have ulcerated the internal parts, you may recognize from spontaneous ulcers. For it happens often to many people, in some from bad foods, in others from a corruption and putrefaction within the body itself—the so‑called bad mixture [dyscrasia]. In such cases at times some of the internal parts are ulcerated; but more often, since by nature the superfluities belonging to one’s condition are rubbed off toward the skin, the skin itself is ulcerated in many with frequent and persistent sores. For cancer, and phagedaena, and the devouring herpes, and carbuncles, and the ulcers called chironea and telephia, and countless other kinds of sores are offspring of such a bad mixture.\n\nThere is, then, nothing puzzling in such matters, nor in the fact that some drugs which do us no harm externally nevertheless work great evil when swallowed; while certain drugs, taken internally, have sometimes harmed and sometimes helped; and some do harm not only within but also from without. In short, nothing is by nature able to act the same way both inside and outside. For neither the foam of a rabid dog, nor that of the asp, nor the venom of the viper—things believed to injure even when they touch from outside without a wound—have equal power when merely brought into contact with the skin as when taken within. Nor, indeed, is it worth marveling if the power of certain drugs does not reach down to the depths; for it is not necessary that all should possess the same strength. And if many substances taken internally have, at one time, and in such-and-such a season, and in such a quantity, and mixed with such things, proved beneficial, but taken unseasonably, and in great amount, and unmixed, have caused harm, there is nothing here that is perplexing in reason. For this holds also of foods, and of fire, and likewise of all things that come into contact with the body. At times we need a measured flame, and by using it we gain great benefit from it, though an immoderate flame burns us. So too a draught of cold—taken in moderation—benefits, but in excess harms most grievously. What, then, is surprising if there is some drug so hot in power that, if taken in large quantity and applied when the body is empty, it utterly corrodes and burns it, but if in small amount or together with agents that curb its strength, not only does it not harm at all, but, by warming, actually does good?",

      "claude_translation": "Therefore, since each of the aforementioned factors is sufficient by itself to prevent mustard from doing internally something such as it did externally on the skin, surely much more so, I think, when all come together at once. For it is altered by being digested, and it is separated, and it is purified, and it is mixed with many other things, and it is divided in many ways, and it is carried everywhere, and it does not remain long in any of the parts. But that, if it had remained pungent, it would certainly have ulcerated the internal parts as well, you will recognize from spontaneous ulcers. For the so-called kakochymia [bad humoral condition] occurs in many people frequently, in some from unwholesome foods, in others from some corruption and putrefaction within the body itself. And in these cases sometimes one of the internal parts is ulcerated; but for the most part, because nature expels the waste products in the bodily condition toward the skin, many people are ulcerated with numerous and continuous ulcers. For cancer, and phagedaina [spreading ulcer], and herpes that eats away, and carbuncles, and the so-called cheironia and telephia [types of ulcers], and countless other kinds of ulcers are offspring of such kakochymia. Therefore neither is any of these matters puzzling, nor why some drugs, while doing us no harm externally, work great evil when swallowed; and some have often harmed when taken internally, but often benefited; and some harm not only from within, but also from without. To speak generally, nothing is naturally disposed to act similarly both internally and externally. For neither the foam of a rabid dog, nor that of the asp, nor the venom of the viper—which are indeed believed to harm even when they fall upon us externally without a wound—have equal power whether they merely contact the skin or are taken internally. Nor indeed is it worth wondering at if the power of certain drugs does not reach to the depths; for it is not necessary that all have the same strength. But if many things taken internally have benefited at this particular time, and with this particular quantity, and with mixture with these particular things, but have brought harm when taken at the wrong time, and in large amounts, and unmixed, there is no difficulty for the argument from this. For this applies also to foods, and to fire, and similarly, one might say, to all things that affect the body. At any rate, we sometimes need a moderate flame, and by using it we derive great benefit from it, even though an immoderate one burns us. So too a moderate drink of cold water benefits, but an immoderate one harms extremely. What then is surprising if there is some drug so hot in power that, if it were taken in large quantity and applied to an empty body, it would completely corrode and burn it, but if it were small in amount or even taken with things that restrain its strength, in addition to not harming at all, it would even benefit by warming?",

One must therefore pay the closest attention, in all things said to be potentially hot or cold, to whether they belong by nature to the class capable of nourishing [i.e., foods], or whether, merely taking the occasion for an alteration, they then, being altered in accordance with their own nature, dispose the body in some way, and, thirdly, in addition to these, whether they are not altered by the body at all in any respect.

For some of such things, being dry in their substances, when melted by much heat, have taken on the appearance of moisture, like copper and iron; or they are moist per se, just as crystal is, but when approaching unmixed coldness, they appear dry. Therefore, one must make the judgment of all these things not simply, as we were also saying in what came before, but with the additional consideration of how they stand in relation to heat or cold. For if, while partaking of little heat, they nevertheless appear moist, they are such through their own nature, and likewise if with abundant heat they are dry. But those things that either flow with boiling heat or have solidified through unmixed cold should not be considered to be moist or dry per se. Therefore, one must distinguish things per se from things accidental in this way, and referring to these very things, make the judgment thus of things potentially hot, or cold, or dry, or moist. For the potential must be judged not in relation to the accidental, but in relation to the per se. And the judgment is common and one for all things: the speed of alteration. Since hot, cold, dry, and moist are spoken of homonymously—for some things are named thus according to predominance, while others are named as having an extreme degree of the quality from which they are denominatively named—whatever of these the thing being judged readily changes into, it will be such potentially. For oil is potentially hot, because it readily becomes flame. And in the same way resin, asphalt, and pitch. Wine, because it readily becomes blood. And in the same way honey, meat, and milk. These things, then, being altered in their whole substances, are foods for the things altering them. But those things that undergo and are changed in alteration according to any single quality whatsoever are only drugs, just as indeed those things that, remaining unchanged in their whole substances, affect the body—these too are drugs, but difficult ones and destructive of the nature of the living being; whence, I think, their whole class is called poison. For one should certainly not say that such things are not poisons by class because, when applied in completely minimal amounts, they bring no perceptible harm whatsoever. For in this way fire would not be hot, nor snow cold; since even very small amounts of these produce no clear effect upon our bodies. For the hundredth part of a single spark is certainly fire by class, but it would not only not burn or warm us, but would not even provide any sensation when it falls upon us. And likewise the hundredth part of a cold drop would not only not harm or cool us, but would not even provide any sensation. Therefore, one must not judge poisons in this way either, but by the opposition to the whole nature, and judge the opposition from the intermediate change. For example, immediately from the elements, neither does water naturally change into fire, nor fire into water, but both change into air, and that into each of them, but these never into one another.",

These, therefore, are contrary and hostile to each other. In the same manner, poppy juice is completely contrary to the human body, being able to act upon it neither according to a single quality, nor much more still according to its entire substance. This, then, is one kind of poison. Another kind consists of those things that receive a certain starting point of transformation from the heat within us, but from this point turn aside into manifold alterations, by which our nature happens to be destroyed. For all such things are poisons by their kind, even if on account of their small quantity they sometimes produce no perceptible effect. Now those things that corrode and putrefy and dissolve the nature of our body are reasonably called hot in potency; while those that cool and numb are called cold. Concerning the former, then, it seems nothing irrational either that they themselves should be affected or that they should produce effects in our bodies. For having approached a hot body and having received from this some impulse toward alteration, some reach an extreme heat, while others reach putrefaction. They therefore reasonably affect the bodies of living creatures according to their own condition. But those things that cool the body, even if you heat them and then apply them, introduce no small difficulty as to what their nature might be. For if they have once become actually hot, why do they not heat the living creature? Or if they have not yet been heated, how do they appear hot? The solution to this difficulty lies in distinguishing what is cold in itself from what is cold accidentally, as Aristotle taught.",

And when things that are by nature cold but incidentally hot come near us, two consequences necessarily follow: their acquired heat is lost, while their proper constitution [krâsis: intrinsic “mixture” or tempering] remains cold, suffering nothing from our body. And what is surprising if the juice of the poppy [opium], or mandrake, or hemlock, or anything of that sort, even if brought to us warmed, a little later becomes cold? Barley gruel [ptisane], milk, groats [chondros], and bread undergo the same experience when they fall into a sick stomach and are not retained by it; indeed, they are often vomited up quite cold. And here is an even stronger point, one noted by Hippocrates: although phlegm is already a humor, and is often generated in the stomach from undigested foods, nevertheless it feels cold to the touch—not only when it has congealed in the stomach, but even when it has been drawn from the very veins by some purgative drug. And yet it is exceedingly viscous and is expelled with force; nevertheless, not even the violence of that traction is able to heat it. What, then, is surprising if the poppy drug—so contrary to our nature—cools down at once, even if it was drunk warm, and cools the body along with itself? For it does not preserve its acquired warmth, since it was by nature cold; and because its substance is not altered by us, but rather it alters and transforms us, it is not warmed by us in any degree, and instead disposes us according to its own character. Being by nature cold, it naturally cools us as well. Accordingly, nothing puzzling remains in the argument. Indeed, the fact that any of these naturally cold things, if overheated for a longer time, departs from its own nature not only leaves no puzzle, but also corroborates what has been said. For just as the salamander, up to a point, suffers nothing from fire, yet is burned if it remains near the fire too long, so too mandrake, hemlock, and psyllium [fleawort/plantain]: after brief contact with fire they still preserve their proper constitution, but if heated further they are immediately destroyed and can no longer perform any of the actions for which they were originally suited. The nature of all such substances is most opposed to human beings; and by “nature” I mean the whole substance and constitution, derived from the primary elements—hot and cold, and dry and wet—whereas those that nourish most quickly are most akin to us. All other substances fall between these: some are more, some less capable of acting on and being acted upon by our body. Thus castoreum and pepper are able to act on our body more than to be acted upon by it, whereas wine, honey, and ptisane are more acted upon than they act.",

And what is surprising if poppy juice, or mandrake, or hemlock, or any such thing, even if you take it after it has been heated, becomes cold a short time later? Barley gruel, milk, groats, and bread suffer this same thing, whenever they fall into a weak stomach and are not mastered by it; at any rate, they are often vomited up quite cold. And what is even more significant than these things, which Hippocrates also noted: although phlegm is already a humor and is often generated in the stomach from undigested foods, nevertheless it appears cold to the touch, not only when it has collected in the stomach, but also when it has been drawn from the veins themselves by some purgative drug. And yet it is extremely viscous and is drawn out forcibly, but nevertheless even the force of the extraction cannot heat it.

Thus it is also with nearly all nourishing things. For these too produce some effect upon the human body, but not a perceptible one, nor anything clear at all. However, their prolonged consumption greatly alters and clearly changes the bodies. Some indeed even at their first use immediately show the alteration clearly, as for example lettuce, which clearly cools and makes free from thirst those who are burning in the stomach, but clearly harms those who are chilled. It contributes not a little also to sleep, not for any other reason, but because it is cold and moist in its mixture [temperament]. But it is moist and cold in relation to man and the other things which it is naturally suited to nourish, as green wood is in relation to fire. So that reasonably both properties belong to such foods: both to affect our bodies as drugs do, and to nourish—throughout the whole time of digestion, as drugs; but when it already nourishes and is completely assimilated, then it no longer acts against us at all, but increases the innate heat, as was said before. For this is now common to all nourishing things, and one should not wonder if something, before being assimilated and nourishing, while still being digested, cooled, but once assimilated and having nourished, warmed—always remembering the example of green wood.",

For indeed it does become hotter, whether you intensify its heat or increase the substance in which it is primarily contained. For suppose that the blood in the body of the living creature is hot in itself, or, by Zeus, if you prefer, the yellow bile, and that all other things are hot accidentally by partaking of these. Will it not be necessary that the living creature becomes hotter in two ways, either by acquiring more hot humors, or by having hotter ones than before? To me at least it certainly appears so. And in the same way, I think, it will also be colder in two ways, either because the cold humors have been nourished underneath [accumulated], such as phlegm and black bile, or because, while the balance of all these remains the same, only the quality has been altered. What then is surprising if, as long as food that is cold by nature is being digested, such as purslane and lettuce, the body is filled with cold quality, but when they have been thoroughly digested and have become good blood, the body again becomes hotter than itself by the generation of hot humor?

And it is nothing remarkable if it happens that lettuce both acts and is acted upon, seeing that even a sword, as we were saying a little earlier, not only acts upon wax, but is also acted upon. But because what it naturally does is much greater than what it suffers, the other aspect escapes notice. But if you were to compare it with the hardest iron, it will appear to you conversely to be acted upon more than to act, although it does act even then, but its power is overlooked because of its smallness. Therefore, we confidently declare simply about all foods that they are naturally disposed not only to be acted upon by our body, but also to act upon it; and indeed also concerning certain things for which the capacity to act exists clearly and manifestly, that they are not only foods but also drugs. Lettuce, then, is both a food and a cold drug; rocket is both a food and a hot drug. And if castoreum is also digested in time, this too would be both a food and a hot drug at the same time. And similarly mustard, and pepper, and among herbs dill and rue, oregano and pennyroyal, calamint and savory and thyme. For all these things are both foods and hot drugs.

And there is nothing marvelous if it has befallen lettuce [thridakine] both to act and to be acted upon, since even for a sword—as we said a little earlier—it not only acts upon wax, but also is acted upon.

      "claude_translation": "Therefore, just as we were saying earlier in the case of lettuce, that one stomach is colder than necessary and another is hotter, so too now let the two stomachs be assumed in the case of all things that are hot in potentiality. Now the one that is colder than necessary, as long as all such things are contained and being digested in it, they will warm it and restore it to an equality of mixture and benefit it in the manner of drugs; but the other one, the hot one, they will set ablaze and greatly harm. And these alterations they will produce in respect to quality. But once they have been thoroughly digested and transformed and have become useful blood, they will increase the innate heat of the animal in respect to substance, not in respect to quality. For in general, whether the food is cold or hot in potentiality, once it has been turned into blood, it will likewise increase the innate heat; but as long as it is being led toward the form of blood but has not yet been completely turned into blood, it cools and heats the body in the manner of a drug. Now this entire argument depends upon a single principle. Therefore one must always preserve it and remember throughout that each of the bodies possesses a certain particular mixture, proper to this particular nature but different from that particular one; and that if it should alter what is proper to it into its own nature, it will thus increase the substance of the heat in it; but if it should be altered, one of two things will happen to it: if what is transforming it is heating, it will acquire a certain heat, but if it is not heating, it will lose its proper heat. It is clear therefore from these considerations that all such things exist in relation to something. For in relation to the particular character of the altering nature, each of the things taken in will have the character either of food or of drug or of both. For example, hemlock is food for the starling but a drug for man; and hellebore is food for quails but a drug for humans. For the mixture of quails is able to assimilate hellebore to itself, but that of humans is not able to do so.",

For if the activity of a drug that has been applied is vivid and plain to sense, one should trust that, disregarding all other marks; but if it is faint, unclear, mixed, or in any way open to dispute, then one should also judge it by all external criteria.

It is fitting, I think, to take our start from the most evident cases; for once someone has trained himself on these, he will more easily follow the less clear ones. Immediately, then, when applying a certain drug or food to the body, let what is applied be free of any intense adventitious heat or cold. For the criterion we established earlier, when we attempted to distinguish moist and dry bodies, will be no less useful now for things hot and cold in power.

For if the action of an applied drug is evident and clear to perception, one must trust this, disregarding all other signs; but if it is faint and unclear, or mixed, or possessing some ambiguity whatsoever, then one must also judge it in relation to all external factors. Therefore, one should not judge even in relation to these factors from a distance, but from the very substance of the thing being investigated—for example, whether oil is hot, not because it is viscous or pale or light, but whether it readily bursts into flame; for this was what it meant to be hot in potentiality: to change quickly into what is hot in actuality. In the same manner also with our bodies, one should judge not whether something is thick-parted or fine-parted or moist or light or viscous or pale, but whether it heats when applied.

If therefore, when applied to an extremely hot condition, it should produce a sensation of cooling, it would thus be cold. Similarly also if to a cold condition it should appear hot immediately, this too would be hot. But if it should appear hot to a hot condition, or cold to a cold condition, do not declare absolutely that the one is hot and the other cold. For sometimes the condition is extremely hot, but the drug is moderately cold, and it has neither altered it, and moreover, having cooled and condensed the entire external surface, it has shut the heat inside and prevented it from being breathed out, and from this has inflamed the condition more greatly. Thus also, even if what is applied to a cold condition brings no heat, one must consider whether something that is moderately hot has done nothing to a condition requiring extreme heat. Therefore the powers of drugs being applied must not be tested in this way, nor if they should produce some effect accidentally and not in themselves. The criterion of what is accidental is both the condition and the time. The condition, if it is simple and single; and the judgment is determined by time in the following ways. What appears clearly to cool or heat immediately upon being applied would surely be such both in itself and through itself; but what does so over time might perhaps be brought to this from some accident, just as in the case of tetanus [spasm], in midsummer, on a young well-fleshed person, the pouring of much cold water produces a return of heat.",

Therefore, just as cold water, upon whatever it falls, immediately cools these things, whether they are animate or inanimate bodies, whether hot or cold, in the same manner—if there were any time, or nature of body, or condition, in which cold water produced a sensation of heat immediately upon contact, it would reasonably be investigated whether it is naturally disposed to heat or to cool by its own nature. But as it is now, since all things, both animate and inanimate, are observed to be cooled immediately and continuously, while those things which have innate heat and a sort of source of fire in the internal organs [splanchna], if cold water is applied to them, it sometimes produces a certain rebound of heat—it is reasonable, I think, that it heats such things accidentally, not by its own nature. And indeed it is apparent in what way. For by condensing the outer surface and shutting in the heat, it produces the return of the warmth from the depths, which is at once concentrated by not being dispersed through evaporation, at once retreating into the depths because of the force of the surrounding cold, and at once being nourished by the humors [chymoi] there. For when, having been concentrated and nourished, it rushes more vigorously toward the surface, there occurs a rebound of heat, and this is proof that cold water does not increase the warmth by its own nature. For by its own nature it cooled the skin; but from this cooling there followed simultaneously both condensation and retreat of the heat into the depths; and from these very things, from the condensation came prevention of evaporation, and from the retreat into the depths came the working upon of the humors there.",

And in turn, the increase of innate heat follows upon each of these. Therefore, through the mediation of each of these processes, cold sometimes produces an increase of heat in the living creature, but never by itself. Moreover, heat sometimes cools accidentally through the mediation of evacuation, as a cold compress [cools] inflammation. For since inflammation occurs from a hot flux, its proper remedy is evacuation of the excess matter, and what invariably follows upon evacuation is the cooling of the part that has been heated by the inflammation. Since there is a twofold condition in inflamed bodies—insofar as concerns the excess of superfluous matter, they depart from the natural state in quantity, and insofar as concerns the heat, in quality—the cure of one of these conditions brings with it the cure of the other as well. And it happens accidentally that drugs which evacuate hot matter also cool the inflammation of the parts. These distinctions must be made, and one must try to discover the degree of the drug's power in accordance with the degree of the simple condition; for example, if the condition is extremely hot, the drug too should be extremely cold; but if the condition falls slightly short of the extreme, the drug too should fall short by a small amount; and if the condition is further removed from extreme heat, the drug should be proportionally removed from extreme coldness. For if you make the beginning of your examination of them from such an estimation, you would more quickly discover the proper power of each. For in general, if in the case of any simple hot affection whatsoever, any drug applied immediately upon first application produces a sensation of cooling, that drug is cold in power, and much more so if it remains such even after the first application and continuously thereafter. But if it also completely cures the hot condition, it is necessarily cold. And it must always be applied lukewarm when it is being tested, as was also said before. Once it has been recognized to be of such a nature, then when it is employed for the sake of treatment, it is better to take it cold, unless the drug is extremely cold but the disease is not extremely hot. These matters, then, will be discussed more fully both in the works on drugs and in the writings on the therapeutic method. But in the present context one must know at least this much: that if any drug applied to a hot and simple condition produces in the patient both the sensation of cooling and [a feeling] of comfort and benefit immediately and in all the time thereafter, this drug is necessarily cold, even if it sometimes appears to be hot in other cases; for it will be found upon careful examination in those cases to be heating not by itself but in some accidental way.",

And in each case again an increase of the innate heat follows. Therefore, through the mediation of each, the cold at times brings about an increase of the animal’s internal heat, though never by itself. Indeed, the hot too sometimes cools incidentally, through the intermediary of evacuation, as depletion [katántlēma: draining/derivation] does for inflammation. For since inflammation arises from a hot flux, its proper remedy is the emptying of the superfluity, and what necessarily follows upon the evacuation is the cooling of the part that has been heated on account of the inflammation. Accordingly, since there is a twofold condition in bodies that are inflamed—so far as there is an excess of superfluous matter they deviate from what is according to nature in respect of quantity, and so far as there is heating they deviate in respect of quality—the cure of the one condition carries along with it the other as well. Thus purgatives of hot matter become incidentally cooling remedies for the inflamed parts and allay their inflammation.\n\nWe must both distinguish these points and try to discover, in proportion to the degree of the simple condition, the degree of the drug’s power; for example, if the condition is in the extreme hot, the drug too must be in the extreme cold; if the condition falls a little short of the extreme, the drug should also fall a little short; and if the condition stands further from the utmost heat, the drug should be proportionately removed from the utmost cold.

      "claude_translation": "Now, having recalled again what I have already said previously, I shall attempt to place the appropriate conclusion upon the present discussion. For since \"hot body\" was said in many ways—for indeed both that which possesses the extreme quality, the element itself, and that which is named according to the predominance of it, and further that which is said in relation to something else, either in relation to the proportionate homogeneous thing or in relation to anything whatsoever—so too must that which is hot potentially but not yet in actuality be both conceived and tested in many ways. Wherefore it is not correct if some people think that whatever does not quickly catch fire is not even potentially hot in relation to us. For if it is easily digestible and nourishes quickly, it would be hot in relation to us; or if it heats when applied as a medicine, this too would be potentially hot in relation to a human being. And in the same way, for each species of animal, the potentially hot, whether as medicine or as nourishment, is said only in relation to that particular animal. For everything potential exists in the category of relation, so that the proper test is better than the external one. And there is one proper test for each thing: if it should be seen to quickly become such as we said it exists potentially. For everything is potentially fire which quickly catches fire; but that is potentially hot in relation to a human being—which was one form of things hot by predominance—whenever, being applied to a human being, it increases either the quality of the innate heat or its substance. And one must consider the same things to have been said also concerning the others, all those things which are said to be potentially cold and dry, and moist and hot. For these too, some in relation to the elements themselves, others as named according to predominance, must both be conceived, and tested, and taught. And it is clear that the touch which judges must also be free from all acquired heat and cold, just as was said previously concerning the medicines themselves.",

      "openai_translation": "Now then, recalling once more what I have already said before, I shall try to bring the present discussion to its fitting close. Since “the hot body” was spoken of in many ways—both as that which possesses the extreme quality, as the element itself, and as what is so called by predominance [kath’ epikratēsin], and further as what is said in relation to something else, either in relation to what is commensurate and of the same kind, or to anything whatsoever by chance—so too must that which is potentially hot but not yet in actuality be conceived and tested in many ways. Hence it is not correct, if something does not quickly ignite, that some suppose it is not even potentially hot in relation to us. For if it is easily digested and nourishes quickly, it would be hot in relation to us; or if, when applied as a drug, it warms, this too would be potentially hot with respect to a human being. And thus, for each species of animal, what is potentially hot—whether as a drug or as food—is said only in relation to that animal. For in all cases what is potential is in relation to something [pros ti]; therefore the proper test [basanos] is better than the external one. And the proper [test] is one for each case, if it should appear that the thing quickly becomes such as we said it is potentially. Fire is potentially anything that quickly ignites; but what is potentially hot with respect to a human being—that was one kind of hot things “by predominance”—is such when, upon being applied to a human being, it increases either the quality of innate heat or the substance [ousia] itself. The same, one must think, has been said of the other things which are called potentially cold and dry, and wet and hot. For these too—some in relation to the elements themselves, others as named by predominance—must be conceived, and tested, and taught. And it is clear that the judging touch must be free from all adventitious [acquired] heat and cold, as was said before also in regard to the drugs themselves.",
