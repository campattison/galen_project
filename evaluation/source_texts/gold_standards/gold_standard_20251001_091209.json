    "greek_text": "Ὅτι μὲν ἐκ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ καὶ ξηροῦ καὶ ὑγροῦ τὰ τῶν ζῴων σώματα κέκραται καὶ ὡς οὐκ ἴση πάντων ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ κράσει μοῖρα, παλαιοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἱκανῶς ἀποδέδεικται φιλοσόφων τε καὶ ἰατρῶν τοῖς ἀρίστοις· εἴρηται δὲ καὶ πρὸς ἡμῶν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν τὰ εἰκότα δι’ ἑτέρου γράμματος, ἐν ᾦ περὶ τῶν καθ’ Ἱπποκράτην στοιχείων ἐσκοπούμεθα. νυνὶ δ’, ὅπερ ἐστὶν ἐφεξῆς ἐκείνῳ, ἁπάσας ἐξευρεῖν τῶν κράσεων τὰς διαφοράς, ὁπόσαι τ’ εἰσὶ καὶ ὁποῖαι κατ’ εἴδη τε καὶ γένη διαιρουμένοις, ἐν τῷδε τῷ γράμματι δίειμι τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν ὀνομάτων ἐξηγήσεως ποιησάμενος. ἐπειδὰν μὲν γὰρ ἐκ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ καὶ ξηροῦ καὶ ὑγροῦ κεκρᾶσθαι λέγωσι τὰ σώματα, τῶν ἄκρως τοιούτων ἀκούειν φασὶ χρῆναι, τουτέστι τῶν στοιχείων αὐτῶν, ἀέρος καὶ πυρὸς καὶ ὕδατος καὶ γῆς· ἐπειδὰν δὲ ζῷον ἢ φυτὸν ἤτοι θερμὸν ἢ ψυχρὸν ἢ ξηρὸν ἢ ὑγρὸν εἶναι λέγωσιν, οὐκέθ’ ὡσαύτως. οὐδὲ γὰρ δύνασθαι ζῷον οὐδὲν οὔτ’ ἄκρως θερμὸν ὑπάρχειν ὡς πῦρ οὔτ’ ἄκρως ὑγρὸν ὡς ὕδωρ. ὡσαύτως δ’ οὐδὲ ψυχρὸν ἢ ξηρὸν ἐσχάτως, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ πλεονεκτοῦντος ἐν τῇ κράσει γίγνεσθαι τὰς προσηγορίας, ὑγρὸν μὲν καλούντων ἡμῶν, ἐν ᾧ πλείων ὑγρότητός ἐστι μοῖρα, ξηρὸν δ’, ἐν ᾧ ξηρότητος· οὕτω δὲ καὶ θερμὸν μέν, ἐν ᾧ τὸ θερμὸν τοῦ ψυχροῦ πλεονεκτεῖ, ψυχρὸν δ’, ἐν ᾧ τὸ ψυχρὸν τοῦ θερμοῦ. αὕτη μὲν ἡ τῶν ὀνομάτων χρῆσις. (Helmreich ed.)",
    "translation": "That the bodies of animals consist of a mixture of hot, cold, dry and wet and that there is not an equal portion of all these in the mixture, has been adequately demonstrated by men of ancient times, the best of both philosophers and doctors; and the appropriate things have been stated by us, too, in a separate work, in which we investigated the elements according to Hippocrates. Now, however, I shall do what follows on from that, namely go through in this work the discovery of all the distinct types of mixtures: how many there are, and of what kind, as one separates them by genus and species; and I shall take my starting point from an explanation of the terms used. When they say that bodies consist of a mixture of hot, cold, dry and wet, they state that one should understand [these terms as applying to] things which are so in the extreme, in other words to the elements themselves: air, ﬁre, water and earth; but when they say that an animal or plant is hot, cold, dry or wet, it is not so in the same way. For, [the argument continues], no animal can be hot in the extreme, like ﬁre, nor wet in the extreme, like water; and likewise, no animal can be cold or dry in their ultimate manifestations. Rather, such appellations derive from that which predominates in the mixture: we call that body wet in which the portion of wetness is greater, and that dry, in which the portion of dryness is greater; and similarly, that hot in which the hot predominates over the cold, and that cold in which the cold predominates over the hot. This, then, is the way in which the terms are used. (On Mixtures 1.1 = Kühn I 509–10, tr. Singer and van der Eijk 2019)"
