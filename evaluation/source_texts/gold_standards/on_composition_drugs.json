    "translation": "Concerning the power of simple drugs, it has already been said in another treatise that one must know the power of each not only according to its kind (as some have written), stating that it is to heat or to cool or to dry or to moisten, but also in a definite and particular fashion, stating what rank it belongs to, as we have made clear. For some drugs accomplish each of the aforementioned powers in a manner that is very obscure, while others do so clearly; others do so vehemently, just as others do so absolutely. It is not then sufficient to know that a given drug is heating or cooling, but one must also specify besides the extent to which it is heating and cooling. For all pine-resins are heating, and this is common to them, but they vary greatly in their heating to a greater or lesser degree. Many juices, too, are heating, but differ greatly from one another in that they heat to a greater or lesser degree. For if you were to compare the juice of panacea with Cyrenaic or Medic juice, it will seem to you that it is nothing in comparison to them. And what need is there for me to divert my argument further, when I am able to remark the difference among those things by which we daily feed ourselves? For at any rate dill, rue, and onion, though they are all heating, different greatly from one another, so that also in medical treatments we will administer to that part which is quite chilled a drug that heats to an ample degree, and for one that departs a little from what is natural we will administer a drug that heats to a moderate degree, just as we will administer to that which is very greatly chilled the one that heats the most intensely. We have fittingly therefore established four ranks among things that are heating, distinguishing from those which heat to a small degree those which do so clearly, and then those which heat to a very great degree, and those which do so intensely along with burning.",
