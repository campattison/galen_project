Concerning these matters there is nothing puzzling, nor about why wine, when drunk, sufficiently warms the body, whereas, when applied to the skin, it does not warm. For it has been shown a little earlier that it warms the animal not simply as a hot drug but as proper nourishment. For just as the suitable nutriments of fire increase the fire, so too, in the case of bodies naturally hot, whatever nutriment is proper and connatural will assuredly strengthen them and increase the innate heat. This is common to all nourishment; but peculiar and exceptional to wine is the speed of its transformation, as with a torch, a wick, tinder, and pitch. And, keeping to the image of fire, let us recall again wet wood, which is itself nutriment for fire, but not immediately nor on the instant; and for this reason, when it is thrown upon the fire, it both smothers the flame—especially if it happens to be weak and small—and brings the danger of extinction.",
