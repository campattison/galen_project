And I too have set forth the probable considerations about these matters in another treatise, in which I examined the elements according to Hippocrates. Now, as a sequel to that, I shall in this treatise go through and discover all the differences of mixtures [krasis], how many there are and of what sorts, dividing them by species and by genera, beginning with an explanation of the terms.\n\nFor when they say that bodies are mixed from hot, cold, dry, and wet, they say one must understand these in their extreme forms—that is, the elements themselves: air, fire, water, and earth. But when it is a matter of an animal, or a plant, or of something being called hot, cold, dry, or wet, it is not in the same way. For no animal can be absolutely hot, like fire, nor absolutely wet, like water; and likewise neither utterly cold nor utterly dry. Rather, the appellations arise from what predominates in the mixture: we call “wet” that in which there is a larger share of wetness, and “dry” that in which there is dryness; and so too “hot” where the hot prevails over the cold, and “cold” where the cold prevails over the hot. Such is the usage of the terms.",

      "claude_translation": "Now it would be time to speak also about the temperaments [mixtures] themselves. The prevailing opinion of the most distinguished physicians and philosophers is that there is a hot and moist temperament, another that is moist and cold, and a third after these that is dry and cold, another that is both dry and hot. But some of them say that there exists a certain temperament that is both moist and cold, and another that is both hot and dry; but neither one that is both moist and hot, nor one that is both cold and dry. For they claim it is not possible either for moisture to coincide with predominant heat, or for dryness to coincide with coldness. For moisture is consumed by prevailing heat, and thus the body becomes both hot and dry, while it remains undigested and unprocessed in those bodies where heat is weak, so that it is necessary, when heat predominates, for dryness to follow, and when coldness predominates, for moisture to accompany it.\n\nThese men, then, have convinced themselves in this way that there are two differences of temperaments in all. But those who think there are four contradict them in two ways: some immediately refuse to accept the first axiom, that it is necessary for moisture to be dried out by prevailing heat; while others grant this but dispute it differently. The first group says that the function of heat is to warm, just as that of cold is to cool, and again that of dryness is to dry, just as that of moisture is to moisten. And for this reason, those bodies which are hot and dry by nature, like fire, insofar as they are hot, warm things, and insofar as they are dry, dry them. But those which are moist and hot, like hot water, these are naturally always suited to moisten and warm, with each quality here too having its own inseparable function. Therefore they do not concede that if something is warming, this immediately also dries; but if moisture is added to heat, it warms and moistens at the same time, like baths of fresh water; but if, just as it is hot, so it is also dry, like fire, it not only warms but also immediately dries, taking this not from its heat but from the dryness accompanying it.\n\nThey remind us here of those who have spent too much time in the summer sun and then, as is natural, have become parched, having their whole body both dry and rough, and thirsting unbearably. For they say the cure for them is ready and easy, not only if they drink, but also if they bathe in hot, fresh waters, since moisture, whether with coldness or with heat, is able to perform its own function, for it moistens things that come near. By the same reasoning they say that dryness also always dries. The north wind, at any rate, being a dry and cold wind, dries and cools everything. And this is what is said by Homer: \"As when the autumn north wind quickly dries the newly-watered field.\"",

      "gemini_translation": "It is now time to speak about the temperaments [Gr. *kraseis*, lit. \"mixtures\"] themselves. The majority opinion, indeed, of the most eminent physicians and philosophers, is that there is one temperament that is moist and hot, another that is moist and cold, a third after these that is dry and cold, and one that is at once dry and hot.\n\nBut some of them say that a certain temperament that is at once moist and cold exists, and another that is at once hot and dry; not, however, one that is at once moist and hot, nor one that is at once cold and dry. For they claim it is not possible for moisture to coexist with a predominating heat, nor for dryness to coexist with coldness. For moisture, they argue, is consumed by a prevailing heat, and thus the body becomes at once hot and dry; while it [moisture] remains undigested and unprocessed in those bodies in which the natural heat is weak, so that it is necessary, when heat is dominant, for dryness to follow, and when coldness has the upper hand, for moisture to ensue. These thinkers, then, have persuaded themselves on these grounds that the varieties of the temperaments are two in all.\n\nBut those who believe there are four argue against them in two ways: some, by not conceding the very first axiom, namely that moisture is necessarily dried out by a prevailing heat; while others concede this point, but dispute it on other grounds. The first group, then, says that the function of the hot is to heat, just as that of the cold is to cool, and in turn that of the dry is to dry, just as that of the moist is to moisten. And for this reason, whatever bodies are by nature at once hot and dry, such as fire, in that they are hot, they heat, and in that they are dry, they dry. But whatever bodies are moist and hot, such as hot water, are by nature suited always to moisten and to heat, with each quality here too possessing its own inseparable function. Therefore, they do not concede that if something is heating, it must immediately also be drying. But rather, if moisture is added to the heat, it heats and moistens at the same time, like baths of fresh water; but if, just as it is hot, it should also be dry, like fire, it not only heats but also immediately dries, deriving this latter effect not from its heat, but from the dryness that accompanies it.\n\nAnd at this point they bring to mind the case of those who have spent too long in the summer sun and then, as is to be expected, have become parched, having their whole body dry and withered, and being unbearably thirsty. For they say that a ready and very easy cure for them is not only to drink, but also to bathe in hot, fresh waters, on the grounds that moisture, whether it is combined with coldness or with heat, is able to perform its own function, which is to moisten whatever it approaches. And according to the same line of reasoning, they say that dryness, too, always dries. The north wind [Boreas], for instance, being a dry and cold wind, dries and cools everything. And this, they say, is what is meant by the line from Homer: \"As when the autumn north wind swiftly dries a newly-watered threshing floor.\"",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 2.2:**\n\nIn the same manner, poppy juice and countless other drugs both dry and cool at the same time. Therefore, it is not necessary that if something is cold, it must immediately also be moist, nor if something is hot, must it immediately also be dry. Consequently, neither must a hot temperament necessarily also be dry, but it is possible that sometimes the hot may predominate over the cold in an animal's temperament, while the moist predominates over the dry. For indeed, generation, alteration, and change occur from opposites into opposites. For who, saying that white has been altered and changed because it became hot, would not be ridiculous? For the argument seeks not the opposition between cold and hot, but the change in color; for white changes into black, just as black changes into white, and hot in turn changes into cold, just as cold changes into hot. In the same way, the moist changes into the dry, and the dry in turn into the moist. For if someone claims that a body has been altered because what was previously moist is now white, or because what was previously dry now appears black, he would not seem to be in his right mind. But if he were to say that what was previously moist has now become dry, or what was formerly black is now white, or has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would seem sensible and to be saying reasonable things. For what changes must, in the respect in which it changes, move toward its opposite. We say, then, that this person has become or is becoming musical, obviously from being non-musical, and literate from being illiterate, and rhetorical from being non-rhetorical; but to say that someone becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being literate, or something from any other heterogeneous thing, is absurd. For it is possible for someone who was previously literate to have now become musical, having acquired music in addition to literacy, not having lost literacy. And surely, if he acquired something while the former remained, it is clear to everyone that he was not altered with respect to what remained. Therefore, he did not become musical from being literate; for he is still literate even now; but he became musical from being unmusical; for it is no longer possible for him to remain unmusical, having already become musical. Since all changes occur by opposites and from opposites into opposites, clearly the moist too, if it ever changes insofar as it is moist, will itself be dried and what dries it will be called dry. Therefore, they say, let them not claim that a temperament cannot be both hot and moist at the same time. For while the same thing cannot be both hot and cold at once, or both moist and dry at once—for opposite qualities cannot coexist in one and the same body—it is possible for something to be both moist and hot at once, and both cold and dry at once, as both reason has demonstrated and the examples given a little earlier.\n\nSuch, then, is the argument of the first group. The argument of the second group says there is nothing absurd, given that heat is the most active of the four [qualities], in its acting not only upon the cold but also upon the moist, for there to be a moist and hot temperament when an abundance of both moisture and heat come together at once right at the first generation of the animal. Their argument shows not that there could never be more moist than dry and more hot than cold in one and the same body, but that such a state could not remain forever; for the moist, being constantly evaporated by the hot, will in time make the body dry; and thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but would be hot and dry. And this very thing again, the hot and dry, with the advance of time will become dry and cold. For when the hot has consumed all its moisture, they say it then begins from that point to waste away itself, no longer having an abundance of nourishment from which it was kindled. They think it is therefore not at all surprising that even at the beginning, right at the first generation of the animal, either more moist than dry or more hot than cold should come together in the same place. And it is possible that in the course of time a temperament that was previously hot and moist should become hot and dry again, just as again the dry and hot temperament, when the heat is extinguished, may become cold and dry.\n\nThat it is possible for something to be both hot and moist at once, and for another temperament to be cold and dry, they demonstrate from these arguments. That it is impossible for there to be more than four different temperaments, they attempt to teach from the following: Given, they say, four qualities that have the capacity to act upon and be affected by one another—heat and cold, and dryness and moisture—two oppositions arise, one in which hot is opposed to cold, the other in which dry is opposed to moist, and therefore all the combinations come to four. For while six combinations arise from the four [qualities] being interwoven with one another, two of these are impossible. For a body cannot be both moist and dry at once, nor cold and hot at once. There remain, then, four combinations of temperaments: two moist ones and two dry ones, distinguished by heat and cold.\n\nThese, then, are the things that the most elegant of the physicians and philosophers before us have said. But it is now time to speak about what I think they have omitted.",

      "openai_translation": "First, then, to begin with: they forgot and completely left out the well-balanced nature [eukrasia: well-proportioned mixture/temperament], as though it did not at all exist, and as though it did not surpass in both excellence and power—although in fact they cannot even say anything about the other states apart from it. For it is impossible even to conceive that the hot has the advantage in a hot mixture, or the cold in a cold one, without first positing the well-balanced [state]. Nor, indeed, when they devise a healthy regimen, do they look to anything other than that well-balanced nature: they bid one to cool a body that is hotter than it should be, and to warm one that is too cold; likewise, to dry what is too moist, and to moisten what is too dry—always, clearly, introducing what is lacking as a counter to what is in excess, in order to produce a certain well-balanced, middle condition. This, then, is the state they are always pursuing, and by looking to it they correct the imbalanced [dyskrasiai: bad mixtures]; and I thought it should be the first of all to be mentioned by them. But they fall so far short of remembering it that they pass it over entirely. “But it has not been omitted,” some of them say; “it is contained in the hot-and-moist.” Then how is it that you say there are not five mixtures in all, but four, if indeed you have remembered the best one? For of the two alternatives, either one of the imbalanced states must have been omitted, or the well-balanced one. I for my part clearly know that they have left out the well-balanced, from the claims they make. For whenever they say “hot and dry,” or “cold and moist,” or name some other mixture, we ought not to understand the extremes of the qualities, but the designation is always made according to what predominates. If, however, they do not wish the well-balanced one to be omitted, they will be shown to have left out one of the others. Let it be granted, then, that the hot-and-moist is the well-balanced, as they wish. Plainly, then, they have left out the mixture opposed to the cold-and-dry imbalance, in which the moist and the hot predominate. “But that,” they",

For it is impossible even to conceive that the hot predominates in the hot temperament, or the cold in the cold temperament, without first positing the well-tempered one. Indeed, they devise a healthy regimen looking to nothing else than that well-tempered nature: commanding that a body hotter than it should be must be cooled, and one that is colder must be warmed; likewise, that the moister must be dried, and the drier moistened, always clearly introducing what is lacking to counter what is excessive, so as to produce a well-tempered and middle state. That which they are always pursuing, and looking to which they correct the ill-tempered states, I thought should be mentioned first of all by them. But they are so far from remembering this that they omit it entirely.\n\nBut it has not been omitted, some of them say, for it is contained in the hot and moist [temperament]. And how is it that you do not say there are five temperaments in all, but four, if you remember the best one? For one of two things is necessary: either one of the ill-tempered ones has been omitted, or the well-tempered one. I clearly know that they have omitted the well-tempered one, from what they maintain. For when they speak of hot and dry, or cold and moist, or any other temperament, they claim we should not understand the extreme qualities, but that the naming always occurs according to what predominates. But if they do not want the well-tempered one to have been omitted, they will be shown to have omitted one of the others.\n\nFor let the moist and hot be well-tempered, as they themselves wish. Then they have clearly omitted the one opposite to the cold and dry dyscrasia [ill-temperament], in which the moist and hot predominate. But this, they say, is that very one. And how is it possible for the hot both to predominate and not predominate at the same time, and for the cold both to be overcome and not be overcome? For if it is well-tempered, nothing excessively predominates over anything else; but if it is ill-tempered, something from the opposition must necessarily predominate.\n\nBut this very thing, they say, is characteristic of the well-tempered state, that in it the hot prevails over the cold, and the moist over the dry; for when the cold prevails, even moderately, the temperament is not good, and still more so, disease already occurs, just as if it should prevail strongly, death results; and so too with the dry, at first dyscrasia occurs, with more [predominance] disease, and with the greatest predominance, death. As if these same things did not also occur with the moist and hot [temperament]. For who would not agree that when either the hot happens to predominate over the cold by a small amount, or the moist over the dry, dyscrasia thus occurs; when by more, disease; when by the most, death? For the same reasoning applies to both.\n\nOr should we not blame excessively moist and hot conditions, nor acknowledge as diseases those hot diseases that arise with excessive moisture? Against such arguments, some of the followers of Athenaeus of Attaleia fight back, saying they find no fault with a moist and hot condition, nor claiming that any disease is found to be moist and hot, but that all are either hot and dry, like fever, or cold and moist, like dropsy, or cold and dry, like melancholy.\n\nThey also mention here the seasons of the year, saying that winter is moist and cold, summer dry and hot, autumn cold and dry, and they call spring both well-tempered and hot and moist; and likewise of the ages [of life], they say childhood is well-tempered and hot and moist. They think its good temperament is shown also from the activities of nature, which are then especially vigorous. And indeed they say that death leads the bodies of living things to dryness and coldness. For the dead are called \"alibantes\" [without moisture], as no longer possessing any flow or moisture, having evaporated due to the departure of heat and having been frozen by the cooling.\n\nBut if death, they say, is such, then life, being its opposite, must necessarily be hot and moist; and indeed if life, they say, is something hot and moist, it is entirely necessary that the temperament most similar to it be the best, and if this is clear to everyone as being the most well-tempered, then the moist and hot nature coincides with the well-tempered one, and good temperament is nothing other than the predominance of moisture and heat.\n\nSuch then are the arguments of Athenaeus's followers. The same opinion seems somehow to belong also to Aristotle the philosopher, and to Theophrastus after him, and to the Stoics, so that they embarrass us with the multitude of witnesses. But I, regarding how Aristotle understood the hot and moist temperament, perhaps, if needed, will show this as the argument proceeds; for they seem to me to misunderstand him.",

For example, it is impossible even to conceive of the hot predominating in the hot temperament, or the cold in the cold one, without first positing the well-tempered one. For indeed, they devise the healthy regimen with an eye to nothing other than that well-tempered nature: they order that a body hotter than it should be is to be cooled, and one colder, in turn, is to be warmed; likewise, that one moister is to be dried, and one drier is to be moistened, clearly always introducing what is lacking to counteract what is in excess, so as to produce a certain well-tempered and intermediate state.\n\nThis state, then, which they always pursue, and looking to which they correct the ill-tempered ones, I, for my part, would have expected them to name first of all. But they, it turns out, are so far from remembering it that they omit it entirely. \"But it has not been omitted,\" some of them say, \"for it is contained in the hot and moist [temperament].\" And how is it that you do not say there are five temperaments in all, but four, if you are indeed taking account of the best one? For one of two things is necessary: either one of the ill-tempered ones has been omitted, or the well-tempered one has. I, for my part, know clearly that they have omitted the well-tempered one, based on their own principles. For when they speak of a hot and dry, or a cold and moist, or any other temperament, they maintain that we are not to understand these as the extreme qualities, but that the designation is always given according to the one that predominates. But if they do not wish for the well-tempered one to have been omitted, they will be shown to have omitted one of the others. For let the moist and hot be the well-tempered one, as they themselves wish. Then they have clearly omitted the imbalance that is opposite to the cold and dry dyscrasia—that is, the one in which the moist and the hot predominate. \"But this,\" they say, \"is that very one.\" And how is it possible for the hot to predominate and at the same time not to predominate, and for the cold to be overcome and not be overcome? For if it is well-tempered, nothing prevails immoderately over anything else; but if it is ill-tempered, it is necessary for one of the opposites to predominate.\n\n\"But this very thing,\" they say, \"is the distinctive property of the well-tempered state: that in it the hot prevails over the cold, and the moist over the dry. For if the cold prevails, even moderately, the temperament is not good; and if it prevails still more, it becomes a disease; just as, if it should prevail intensely, it results in death. And the same thing happens in the case of the dry: at first an imbalance, then with more, a disease, and when it prevails most of all, death.\" As if these things do not also happen in the case of the moist and hot temperament! For who would not agree that when the hot happens to predominate slightly over the cold, or the moist over the dry, an imbalance is thus produced; and when it does so to a greater degree, a disease; and when to the greatest degree, death? For the same principle applies to both sides. Or else, let us not blame immoderately moist and hot conditions, nor admit that those diseases which are established with immoderate moistness and heat are diseases at all.\n\nNow, fighting back against such arguments, some from the school of Athenaeus of Attaleia go on the offensive, saying that they neither find fault with a moist and hot condition, nor do they maintain that any disease is found to be moist and hot, but that a disease is always either hot and dry, like fever; or cold and moist, like dropsy; or cold and dry, like melancholy. And at this point they also bring up the seasons of the year, stating that winter is moist and cold, summer is dry and hot, and autumn is cold and dry; but spring they call a season that is at once well-tempered, hot, and moist. And in the same way, they say that among the ages of life, childhood is well-tempered, hot, and moist. And they think its well-tempered state is also shown by the activities of nature, which are strongest at that time. And indeed, they also say that death leads the bodies of living creatures into a state of dryness and coldness. At any rate, the dead are called *alibantes* [lifeless/un-moistened], as if they no longer possess any *libas* [stream] or moisture, having been evaporated by the departure of their heat and solidified by the cold. \"But if death,\" they say, \"is of such a nature, it is then necessary for life, being its opposite, to be both hot and moist. Moreover, if life,\" they say, \"is something hot and moist, it is absolutely necessary that the temperament most like it be the best; and if this is clearly the most well-tempered one, it follows that the hot and moist nature is identical to the well-tempered one, and that the well-tempered state is nothing other than the predominance of moistness and heat.\"\n\nSuch, then, are the arguments of the school of Athenaeus. And this same opinion also seems to be that of the philosopher Aristotle, and of Theophrastus after him, and of the Stoics, so that they overwhelm us with the number of their witnesses. But as for Aristotle and what he thought about the hot and moist temperament, I could perhaps show, if it were necessary and when my argument has advanced further, that they seem to me to have misheard him.",

      "openai_translation": "As to the matter now before us, I will first try to show to those who say such things how they contrive their reasoning, and then, in sequence, set forth the whole argument, gathering it into a single head. That they think spring is at once warm and moist and well-tempered [eukratos: in good balance] is quite plainly the way they reason. For it is neither moist like winter nor warm like summer, and thus in neither respect excessive. Now each of those names indicates excess, even by their own account. They have erred in two ways, first by wishing absolutely to find among the seasons the fourth pairing [syzygia] of the mixtures [kraseis: combinations of qualities], and then by assuming that it is both warmer than winter and moister than summer. But it is neither necessary to posit the fourth pairing of mixtures among the seasons unless it also appears, nor will comparing it with the seasons on either side show it to be any more moist and warm than cold and dry. For if “the moist” and “the warm” are names of excess, then their claim is not true; for spring is proportionate in all respects. But if, because it is moister than summer and warmer than winter, it is moist and warm, then no less should it be considered cold and dry, since it is colder than summer and drier than winter. Or what sort of allotment is it, to take one of the contrasting pairings from winter and one from summer? For since in each of those it differs in both respects, the comparison ought not to be made by halves, but to stand complete. And indeed, if the comparison were made in this way, we would say that the contraries belong to it: it will be warm and dry if compared with winter, but cold and moist if compared with summer. Therefore, by neither comparison, taken as a whole, will it be moist and warm. And if they are permitted, by taking a half from each side, to pronounce it moist and warm, surely it will be permitted to us, by turning to the other half, to pronounce it dry and cold—dry in relation to winter, cold in relation to summer. Thus in this way spring will be all things: moist, dry, warm, cold. But even by their own account it is not possible for the four qualities to be predominant in one and the same subject; therefore one should compare spring neither with summer nor with winter, but examine it in itself. For we do not say winter is moist and cold for this reason—that it is the moistest and coldest of the seasons—but this has happened to it otherwise; and because in it moisture exceeds dryness and coldness warmth, on that account it is called cold and moist. And in the same way summer, because in it the moist is surpassed by the dry and the cold by the warm, is called warm and dry. It is just, then, that each of the seasons, examined in accordance with its own nature and not by comparison with some other, be named as warm, or cold, or dry, or moist. And in fact, if you examine the matter in this way, it will appear to you that spring lies precisely in the middle of all excesses. For neither, as in winter, does cold in it prevail over warmth, nor, as in summer, is it outmatched. And likewise there is in it a certain equal share of dryness and moisture, neither as in summer where the dry dominates, nor as in winter where the moist does. On this account it was rightly said by Hippocrates: “Spring is the most healthful and least deadly.” But autumn is less warm than summer and less cold than winter. So in this respect it is neither simply warm nor simply cold; it is both, and neither to an extreme. Yet there is some other fault in it, which Hippocrates also marked in the Aphorisms, saying: “Whenever in the same day at one time there is heat and at another time cold, one must expect autumnal diseases.” And this is what makes autumn especially disease-producing—the irregularity of its mixture [krasis]. It is therefore not correctly said to be cold and dry; for it is not cold when considered in itself, like winter, but only when compared with summer it is colder. Nor is it evenly well-tempered like spring; rather, it differs from that season most of all in that it does not possess a steady equality of good mixture [eukrasia] and evenness throughout. For it is much warmer at midday than in the morning or evening. As to moisture and dryness, it is not precisely in the middle, as spring is, but leans toward the drier side; and in this too it falls short of summer, though not so much as in warmth. It is clear, then, that neither should autumn be spoken of simply, as they say, as being both cold and dry. For it is neither of these to an extreme, though in it the dry predominates over the moist. And it would be rightly said in this respect to be dry, but, in the difference regarding warmth and cold, mixed of both and irregular. Therefore, if they are eager to distribute the four pairings of mixtures among the four seasons, let them know that they have wrongly assigned moisture and warmth to spring as a mixture, and likewise coldness and dryness to autumn. And yet even if this were conceded—that autumn is dry and cold—it would not at once be necessary that spring be moist and warm. For even if there are four in all the pairings of immoderate mixtures, it is not necessary that all be apportioned among the four seasons. Rather, if there is some order in the cosmos, and all things are arranged for the better and not for the worse, it would be more plausible that most of the seasons are well-tempered, and that only one of them, if at all, is ill-tempered [dyskritos/dyskratēs: of bad mixture]. But they are eager to prove the contrary—that no season is well-tempered, but of necessity now the warm prevails in them, then the cold, and now, perchance, the dry, and then the moist. I, for my part, am so far from declaring spring to be moist and warm, or from conceding that whatever is well-tempered is warm and moist, that I declare quite the opposite: the worst condition of mixture of the surrounding air is the warm and moist, which you would not find at all among the seasons, but which sometimes occurs in sickly and pestilential states, as Hippocrates somewhere also recorded, saying: “There was rain in heat, with scalding water, continuously.” For this is characteristic of a warm and moist condition—that it rains continuously in heats. But if there were only heat, as in a summer that is according to nature, or it rains indeed, but in cold, as in winter, it would be impossible for the condition to be such as to be warm and moist. Was that summer, then, free from disease, in which, he says, “there was rain in heat, with scalding water, continuously”? And he also relates that carbuncles [anthrakes] occurred in it, plainly because the superfluities in the body putrefied, producing certain ichors excessively warm and moist.

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 4:**\n\nBut as things now stand, I will first try to demonstrate to those who say these things how they are deceiving themselves, and then subsequently display the entire argument, gathering it into one main point. Now, the fact that they think spring is hot and moist at the same time and well-tempered - from this they are clearly engaging in sophistry. For it is neither moist like winter, nor hot like summer, so neither quality is excessive. But each of these terms was indicative of excess, even according to those very people. They have erred in two ways: first, from wanting at all costs to find the fourth combination of temperaments in the seasons, and second, from the fact that it [spring] is both warmer than in winter and moister than in summer. But it is not necessary to suppose the fourth combination of temperaments exists in the seasons unless it actually appears so, and comparing it to the seasons on either side will no more prove it moist and hot than cold and dry.\n\nFor if \"moist\" and \"hot\" are names of excesses, they are not true according to them; for spring is moderate in all things. But if it is moist and hot because it is moister than summer and warmer than winter, it should no less be considered cold and dry, because it is colder than summer and drier than winter. Or what kind of arbitrary selection is it to take one element from the opposition from winter and one from summer? For differing in both respects from each season, it ought not to have the comparison made halfway, but should have it complete. And indeed, if it were done this way, we would say opposite qualities belong to it. For it will be hot and dry if compared to winter, but cold and moist if compared to summer. According to neither comparison made completely will it be moist and hot.\n\nBut if it is permitted to them, taking half from each comparison, to declare it moist and hot, it will surely be permitted to us, turning to the other half, to declare it dry and cold - dry in relation to winter, cold in relation to summer. Thus spring will be everything: moist, dry, hot, cold. But even according to those very people, it is not possible for the four qualities to predominate in one and the same thing. Therefore, it is not right to compare spring either to summer or to winter, but to examine it in itself. For we do not say winter is moist and cold because it is the moistest and coldest of the other seasons. Rather, this happens to it incidentally; but because in it moisture predominates over dryness and coldness over heat, for this reason it is said to be cold and moist.\n\nIn the same way summer too, because in it the moist falls short of the dry and the cold of the hot, for this reason is said to be hot and dry. For it is right that each of the seasons, being examined from its own nature and not compared to any other, should be called either hot or cold or dry or moist. And indeed, examining it in this way, spring will appear to you precisely in the middle of all excesses. For neither does the cold predominate over the hot in it as in winter, nor is it predominated over as in summer. In the same way there is a kind of equal share of dryness and moisture in it, with neither the dry prevailing as in summer nor the moist as in winter. For this reason it was correctly said by Hippocrates: \"Spring is most healthy and least deadly.\"\n\nBut autumn too is less hot than summer and less cold than winter. So in this respect it is neither simply hot nor cold, for it is both and neither extremely. But another evil is present in it, which Hippocrates also indicated in the Aphorisms, saying: \"When on the same day there is sometimes warmth and sometimes cold, one must expect autumnal diseases.\" And this is what especially makes autumn disease-producing: the irregularity of temperament. Therefore it is not correctly said to be cold and dry, for it is not cold when considered in itself, like winter, but compared to summer, it is colder than that. Nor is it uniformly well-tempered like spring, but differs most from that season in that it does not possess temperance and uniformity equally throughout. For it is much hotter at midday than at dawn and evening. And in moisture and dryness it is not precisely in the middle like spring, but inclines toward the drier. It falls short of summer in this too, though not as much as in heat.\n\nIt is clear, then, that autumn should not simply be called, as they say, cold and dry. For it is neither quality extremely, but the dry predominates over the moist in it. And it might justly be called dry in this respect, but in the difference regarding heat and cold, mixed from both and irregular. So if they are eager to distribute the four combinations of temperaments among the four seasons, let them know that they have not only wrongly attributed moisture and heat of temperament to spring, but also coldness and dryness to autumn.\n\nAnd yet, even if this were granted to be dry and cold, it was not immediately necessary for spring to be moist and hot. For if there are four combinations of immoderate temperaments in all, it is not yet necessary for all to be distributed among the four seasons. But if indeed there is some order in the cosmos, and all things are arranged according to the better rather than the worse, it would be more plausible that most seasons were made well-tempered, and one of them, if any, ill-tempered. But they are eager to prove the opposite, that none of the seasons is well-tempered, but necessarily in them now the hot predominates, then the cold, and now, perhaps, the dry, then the moist.\n\nBut I am so far from declaring spring moist and hot, or granting that whatever is well-tempered is hot and moist, that I declare quite the opposite: that the hot and moist condition of the surrounding air's temperament is the worst, which you would not find at all in the seasons, but sometimes occurs in diseased and pestilential conditions, as Hippocrates somewhere mentioned, saying: \"It rained in the heat with violent water throughout.\" For this is characteristic of a moist and hot condition, to rain continuously in heat. But if there were only heat, as in a natural summer, or if it rains but in cold, as in winter, such a condition cannot be hot and moist.\n\nWas that summer then disease-free, in which he says \"it rained in the heat with violent water throughout\"? And yet he relates that carbuncles occurred in it, clearly from the putrefaction of the excretions in the body, generating certain excessively hot and moist ichors [serum-like fluids]. You will know from the passage itself, if I transcribe it all for you, which goes like this: \"Summer carbuncles in Cranon. It rained in the heat with violent water throughout. They occurred more with the south wind; and ichors formed under the skin; when trapped they became hot and caused itching; then blisters like burns rose up, and it seemed to burn under the skin.\"\n\nBut here, with only one season altered, the evil was less. But if two or three were changed, or the whole year became moist and hot, the greatest plague would necessarily occur, such as he describes in the third book of Epidemics. I will first transcribe what he said about the disorder of the seasons, and then what about the subsequent destruction of people. In all these matters I ask you to pay careful attention and consider: first, what kind of thing a hot and moist temperament is, how it is nothing like spring, a well-tempered thing; second, how everything must putrefy in it.\n\nHippocrates begins his narrative thus: \"A southerly year, rainy, windlessness throughout.\" Then to these he adds the particulars of the whole condition, writing that many rains occurred in a warm and southerly condition, then again bringing the whole account to one heading at the end thus: \"The whole year being,\" he says, \"southerly and moist and mild, these and those things happened,\" all of which would be lengthy to record in this discourse. But anyone who wishes, taking the third book of Epidemics, can read the particulars, all reduced to one heading: the greatest putrefaction, which Hippocrates himself often mentions by name, sometimes saying something like this: \"The flux that formed was not like pus, but another kind of putrefaction, and much and varied flux\"; and sometimes again thus: \"And in the genitals, the carbuncles of summer, and other things called putrefaction.\"\n\nAnd how from this putrefaction for many the arm and forearm fell off completely, for many the thigh or parts around the shin were stripped bare, and the whole foot. But also great losses of bones, flesh, sinews, and joints occurred. And in general, nothing can be found of the conditions he wrote about that is not offspring of putrefaction, rightly",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 4:**\n\nFor the time being, I will try first to point out to those who say these things where on earth they deceive themselves with sophistry, and then, in order, to set forth the entire argument, gathering it into a single main point. That they think spring is hot and moist and at the same time well-tempered—herein they are obviously deceiving themselves. For it is neither moist like winter, nor hot like summer, so that it is neither of these immoderately. But each of these names [hot, moist, etc.] was, even according to those men themselves, indicative of an immoderation. They have erred in two ways: first, from wanting at all costs to find the fourth conjugation of temperaments [συζυγίαν τῶν κράσεων] among the seasons, and second, from the fact that spring is hotter than winter and moister than summer. But it is not necessary to posit the fourth conjugation of temperaments among the seasons if it is not also apparent, and comparing spring to the seasons on either side will no more prove it moist and hot than cold and dry. For if ‘moist’ and ‘hot’ are names for immoderation, this is not true in their case, for spring is moderate in all respects. But if, because it is moister than summer and hotter than winter, it is therefore moist and hot, then it is no less fitting to consider it cold and dry, because it is colder than summer and drier than winter. Or what principle of selection is this, to take one quality from the comparison with winter, and one from the comparison with summer? For since it differs from each season in both respects, it ought not to have the comparison by halves, but to have it whole. And indeed, if this were done, we would say that opposite qualities belong to it. For it will be hot and dry if compared to winter, but cold and moist, in turn, if compared to summer. Therefore, by neither comparison, when made in its entirety, will it be moist and hot. But if it is permissible for them, by taking half from each of the two seasons, to declare it moist and hot, then it will surely be permissible for us too, by turning to the other half, to declare it dry and cold—dry in relation to winter, and cold in relation to summer. Thus spring will be all things: moist, dry, hot, and cold. But not even according to those men themselves is it possible for the four qualities to predominate in one and the same thing; therefore, it is right neither to compare spring to summer nor to winter, but to examine it in and of itself.\n\nFor we do not say that winter is moist and cold because it is the most moist and most cold of the other seasons. Rather, while this is also true of it for other reasons, it is said to be cold and moist because in it moisture prevails over dryness, and coldness over heat. And in the same way for summer: because in it the moist is deficient compared to the dry, and the cold compared to the hot, for this reason it is said to be hot and dry. For it is right that each of the seasons be named hot, or cold, or dry, or moist by being examined based on its own nature, not by being compared to some other. And indeed, if you examine it in this way, spring will appear to you as being precisely in the middle of all the excesses. For neither does the cold prevail over the hot in it, as in winter, nor is it prevailed over, as in summer. And in the same way, there is a certain equal balance [ἰσομοιρία] of dryness and moisture in it, with neither the dry dominating as in summer, nor the moist as in winter. For this reason it was rightly said by Hippocrates, “Spring is the most healthful and least deadly.”\n\nBut autumn, too, is less hot than summer and less cold than winter. So in this respect it is neither simply hot nor cold, for it is both, and neither to an extreme. But another evil is present in it, which Hippocrates also noted in the *Aphorisms*, saying: “Whenever in the same day it is at one time hot and at another time cold, one must expect autumnal diseases.” And this is what makes autumn especially morbid: the unevenness of its temperament. It is not correctly said, therefore, to be cold and dry, for it is not cold when considered in and of itself, as winter is, but only when compared to summer, being colder than it. Nor, however, is it evenly well-tempered, like spring; rather, it differs from that season most of all in this: that it does not possess its well-tempered and even quality equally throughout. For it is much hotter around midday than at dawn and dusk. And in moisture and dryness it is not precisely in the middle, like spring, but inclines toward the drier. Yet in this, too, it falls short of summer, though not by as much as it does in heat. It is clear, then, that autumn should not be spoken of so simply as they say, as being cold and dry. For it is neither of these to an extreme, but the dry does predominate in it over the moist. And it might justly be called dry in this respect, but in respect to the difference between heat and cold, it would be called mixed of both and uneven.\n\nSo if they are eager to distribute the four conjugations of temperaments among the four seasons, let them know that they have not only wrongly attached the moist and hot temperament to spring, but also the cold and dry to autumn. And yet, even if it were conceded that autumn is dry and cold, it was not immediately necessary for spring to be moist and hot. For it is not the case that, if there are four conjugations of immoderate temperaments in all, it is immediately necessary that all of them be distributed among the four seasons. But if there is indeed some order in the cosmos, and all things have been ordered for the better, not for the worse, it would have been more plausible for most of the seasons to be well-tempered, and only one of them, if any, to be ill-tempered. But these men are eager to prove the opposite: that no one of the seasons is well-tempered, but that of necessity in them at one time the hot prevails, at another the cold, and at one time, as it may be, the dry, at another the moist.\n\nBut I am so far from declaring spring to be moist and hot, or from agreeing that whatever is well-tempered is hot and moist, that I declare the very opposite: that the worst constitutional state of the surrounding air is the hot and moist one. This you would not find at all among the seasons, but it sometimes occurs in morbid and pestilential conditions, just as Hippocrates somewhere mentioned, saying: “It rained during a heatwave with torrential water throughout.” For this is the peculiar mark of a moist and hot condition: to rain continuously during a heatwave. But if there were only a heatwave, as in a natural summer, or if it rained, but in the cold, as in winter, it is not possible for such a condition to be hot and moist. Was that summer, then, a healthy one, in which, he says, “it rained during a heatwave with torrential water throughout”? And yet he relates that carbuncles arose during it, clearly from the putrefaction [σηπεδών] of the superfluities in the body, which generated hot and moist ichors immoderately. You will know this from the passage itself, if I write it out for you in its entirety, which runs as follows: “Summer carbuncles in Cranon. It rained during a heatwave with torrential water throughout. They occurred more with the South Wind; and ichors formed under the skin; and being trapped they grew hot and produced itching; then blisters like burns rose up, and they seemed to be burning under the skin.” But in this case, since only one season was disordered, the evil was less; but if two or three were altered, or if the entire year became moist and hot, it is necessary that a very great plague would result, such as he relates in the third book of the *Epidemics*. I will write out first what he said about the disorder of the seasons, and then in order what he said about the ensuing destruction of human beings. And in all of this I ask you to pay close attention and to consider, first, what sort of thing a hot and moist temperament is, how it is nothing like spring, a well-tempered thing; and second, how it is necessary for all things to putrefy in it. Hippocrates, then, begins his account thus: “A south-windy year, rainy, with calm throughout.” Then he adds to this the details of the entire condition, writing that many rains occurred in a hot and south-windy state, and then again, bringing the whole account together into one main point at the end, he says: “The whole year having been south-windy, and moist, and mild, such and such things followed.” To write all these things down in the present work would be lengthy, but it is possible for one who wishes, by taking up the third book of the *Epidemics*, to read the details, which all lead to one main point: a very great putrefaction. Hippocrates himself mentions this putrefaction by name many times, sometimes saying something like this: “And the discharge that formed was not like pus, but some other kind of putrefaction, and a great and varied discharge”; and at another time again, like this: “And on the genitals, the carbuncles that occur in summer, and other things which are called ‘sepsis’ [putrefaction], and how from this sepsis, in many cases the whole arm and forearm rotted off, and in many the thigh or the parts around the shin were stripped bare, and the whole foot.” But also great sloughing-off of bones, and flesh, and sinews, and joints occurred. And in general, it is not possible to find any of the afflictions he wrote about which is not, fittingly, an offspring of putrefaction.\n\nFor nothing is naturally disposed to putrefy from the dry, nor from the cold. You might learn this if you were to observe meats and all other things preserved by men, some prepared well with salt, some with brine, some with vinegar, and some with another of the drying agents. You might also learn how in the north wind, which is by nature dry and cold, all things remain unputrefied for a very long time; but they readily putrefy in south-windy conditions. For this wind, too, is moist and hot. Therefore we declare the very opposite of those who suppose spring to be moist and hot. For it is neither such a thing, nor would it be healthful if it were. But they say both that it is such a thing, and that for this reason it is healthful, erring in both respects: both in what can be discerned by the senses, and in what can be examined by reason. For by the senses it is possible to learn clearly that it is precisely well-tempered, and by reason to discover that it is healthful for this reason: because none of the four qualities predominates in it. But if either the hot predominated greatly over the cold, or the moist over the dry, it would have been productive of putrefactions and thus the most morbid of all the seasons. But the equal balance of the four qualities is the cause of both its well-tempered nature and its healthfulness.\n\nWhence, then, did it occur to certain physicians and philosophers to declare spring moist and hot? Clearly, from wanting to distribute the four conjugations of temperaments among the four seasons. And this, in turn, came about from their having omitted the first [temperament] of all, the well-tempered one. For indeed, they trace back the differences of regimens, of drugs, and of all existing things to these four conjugations.",

      "openai_translation": "Hence it is clear how far reasonings about the nature of the human being, when they slip from the truth, harm cures, and that it is better to do one of two things: either not to touch such discussions at all, but entrust everything to experience, or first to train oneself in logical theory. But to pay no attention to experience, and to attempt natural theory before properly exercising the reasoning by which we intend to discover it, must lead to sophistries of this sort, and it forces one—even regarding phenomena—to argue as if without perception, and to call Aristotle as a witness while mishearing what he teaches. For he recognizes “the hot,” “the cold,” “the dry,” and “the moist” in many ways; but they do not hear him in many ways, always in the same way. And Aristotle has also gone through the point that it is not the same thing for heat to belong as something proper and inborn, and for it to belong as something acquired and alien; but they disregard this too. Moreover, Aristotle—and likewise Theophrastus—have stated precisely what one must keep in view when judging nature to be either well-mixed or ill-mixed [eukratos = well-balanced; dyskratos = ill-balanced]. But they are unaware even of this; rather, when they hear them say that the animal is moist and hot, or that the child’s krasis is moist and hot [krasis = mixture/temperament], they neither understand how these things are said, and they clumsily transfer the account to the seasons, as though it were the same—or not much different—whether one’s own krasis is moist and hot, or that of the air surrounding us. For it is neither the same nor is the krasis of an animal called “moist and hot” in the same way as the krasis of air is called “moist and hot.”\n\nWhat the cause of all this was, I will now relate, and I will show clearly to those willing to pay attention that small slips in the things taught at the beginning of logical theory become causes of the greatest errors, and that everything done badly—both in all the arts and, what is more, in the actions of life—tends to be accompanied by sophistries. Accordingly, the following sophistries too result from not having made a correct distinction concerning the things signified: namely, the notion that “hot” is said in two ways—one way as untempered, unmixed, and simple, and the other as prevailing in the mixture with its opposite. And they also forget that, when comparing one krasis with another, we often pronounce one of them to be hot.\n\nAnd in this way animals are said by the ancients to be hot and moist, not simply according to their own krasis, but by comparison with plants and with the dead; for animals are hotter and moister than the dead and than plants. And indeed, even among animals themselves, when species are compared with species, the dog is drier, the human being moister. But if you compare the dog with the ant and the bee, you will find those drier, but the dog moister. So the same animal is dry with respect to a human being, but moist with respect to a bee; and likewise hot with respect to a human being, but cold with respect to a lion. And there is nothing remarkable if what is said relative to something else admits opposite predicates at the same time. For it is not absurd if the same body is called hot and cold at once—but it would be if it were so with respect to the same thing. For it is not strange that the same man is at once right and left; if he is right with respect to one person and left with respect to another, there is nothing strange. Thus, then, a dog is at once moist and dry, and at once hot and cold—but not with respect",

But to neither pay attention to experience nor attempt natural theory before properly training the reasoning by which we would discover it, necessarily leads to such sophistries, and compels us to discuss observable phenomena as if we were insensible, and to call Aristotle as witness while misunderstanding what he teaches. For Aristotle knows that the hot, the cold, the dry, and the moist are spoken of in many ways; but they do not hear him saying \"in many ways,\" but always in the same way. And indeed Aristotle has explained that it is not the same thing for something to be hot by its own innate heat or by acquired and foreign heat; but they misunderstand this too. Furthermore, Aristotle, and likewise Theophrastus, have stated precisely what one should consider when determining whether a nature is well-tempered or ill-tempered. But they do not understand even this, but when they hear them saying that an animal is moist and hot, or that a child's temperament [krasis] is moist and hot, they neither understand how these things are meant, nor do they sensibly transfer the argument to the seasons, as if it were the same thing, and not vastly different, for one's own temperament to be moist and hot versus that of the air surrounding us. For neither is it the same thing nor is an animal's temperament called moist and hot in the same way as air's moist and hot temperament. \n\nI will now explain what was the cause of all these errors, and I will show clearly to those willing to pay attention how small mistakes in what is taught at the beginning of logical theory become causes of the greatest errors, and there is a danger that all things done badly in all arts and indeed in life's actions follow from sophistries. These sophistries, then, follow from not correctly distinguishing meanings. But they think that \"hot\" is said in two ways: one as unmixed and unblended and simple, the other as predominating in mixture with its opposite. They also forget that we often, by comparing one temperament to another, declare one of them to be hot. And indeed, animals are called hot and moist by the ancients in this way, not simply according to their own temperament, but when compared to plants and dead things. For animals are hotter and moister than dead things and plants. And indeed, when animals themselves are compared to each other by species, the dog is drier, but man is moister. But if you compare the dog to an ant and a bee, those are drier, and you will find the dog moister. So the same animal is dry in relation to man, but moist in relation to a bee; and likewise hot in relation to man, but cold in relation to a lion. And it is not surprising if what is said in relation to something else admits contrary predications simultaneously. For it is not absurd if the same body is called hot and cold at the same time, but it would be if in relation to the same thing. For it is not absurd that the same person is both right and left; if he is right in relation to one person and left in relation to another, nothing is absurd. Thus also a dog is simultaneously moist and dry, and simultaneously hot and cold, but not in relation to the same thing; for in relation to man he is dry, but moist in relation to an ant, and in relation to man he is hot, but cold in relation to a lion. For indeed he is hot as a living thing; for if something has died, it is not hot; but not hot in relation to another dog, if it so happens. All these things, then, are said in relation to each other by comparison, but things within the genus of animals are spoken of in another way, as also within a species of animal. For a dog, in relation to an ant and bee, is moist, but within the genus of animals, dry. And among dogs themselves by species, this one is dry, this one moist, and another, as a dog, is well-tempered.",

These sophisms, therefore, follow from not distinguishing correctly about the meanings of words, but from supposing that ‘the hot’ is spoken of in only two ways: one as unmixed, unblended, and simple, and the other as predominating in a mixture with its opposite. And they also forget this: that by comparing one temperament with another, we often declare one of them to be hot.\n\nAnd yet this is how animals are called hot and moist by the ancients: not absolutely according to their own temperament, but by comparison with plants and dead things. For living animals are hotter and moister than dead ones and than plants. And indeed, when animals themselves are compared with one another according to their species, the dog is drier, and the man is moister. But if you were to compare the dog with an ant and a bee, you will find them to be drier, and the dog moister.

And it is not at all surprising if that which is spoken of in relation to something else admits of opposite predications at the same time. For it is not absurd for the same body to be called both hot and cold at the same time, but only if it were in relation to the same thing. For it is not absurd that the same man is at once on the right and on the left; if he is on the right in relation to one person and on the left in relation to another, there is nothing absurd at all. Thus, a dog is at once moist and dry, and at once hot and cold, but not in relation to the same thing. For in relation to a man it is dry, but moist in relation to an ant; and in relation to a man it is hot, but cold in relation to a lion.\n\nAnd indeed, it is hot insofar as it is living—for if something is dead, it is not hot—but it is not necessarily hot in relation to another dog, if it so happens. All these things, then, are said in comparison with one another. But things are said in another way with respect to the genus of animals, and again in yet another way with respect to the species of animal. For a dog is moist in relation to an ant and a bee, but dry with respect to the genus of animals. And among dogs themselves, with respect to the species, this one may be dry, that one moist, and some other one, for a dog, well-tempered.",

ὡς, ἐπειδὴ μὲν ἁπλῶς οὐσία τις εὔκρατος λέλεκται, καὶ ταύτης δέ τις ἑτέρα ξηροτέρα καὶ θερμοτέρα, καὶ ψυχροτέρα καὶ ὑγροτέρα, τὴν μὲν εὔκρατον ἐνταῦθα τὴν ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων ἀκριβῶς ἴσων συνελθόντων ὀνομάζομεν, ὅσον δ’ ἀπολείπεται τῆσδε καὶ πλεονεκτεῖ κατά τι, τῷ τοῦ πλεονεκτοῦντος ὀνόματι προσαγορεύομεν· ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἤτοι φυτὸν ἢ ζῶον εὔκρατον ὁτιοῦν εἴπωμεν, οὐκ ἔθ’ ἁπλῶς ἐν τῇ τοιαύτῃ τάξει τἀναντία παραβάλλομεν ἀλλήλοις, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὴν τοῦ φυτοῦ φύσιν ἢ τὴν τοῦ ζώου τὴν ἀναφορὰν ποιούμεθα, συκῆν μὲν εὔκρατον, εἰ τύχοι, λέγοντες, ὅταν, οἵαν μάλιστα πρέπει τὴν φύσιν ὑπάρχειν συκῇ, τοιαύτη

καὶ μέσην ἐν τῷ σφετέρῳ γένει κρᾶσιν ἔχειν ἐροῦμεν οὐχ ἁπλῶς, ὅταν ἰσότης ἀκριβῶς ᾖ τῶν ἐναντίων, ἀλλ’ ὅταν ἡ κατὰ δύναμιν αὐτῆς ὑπάρχῃ συμμετρία. τοιοῦτο δέ τι καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην εἶναί φαμεν, οὐ σταθμῷ καὶ μέτρῳ τὸ ἴσον, ἀλλὰ τῷ προσήκοντί γε καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἐξετάζοντες. ἰσότης οὖν κράσεως ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς εὐκράτοις ζώοις τε καὶ φυτοῖς ἐστιν, οὐχ ἡ κατὰ τῶν κερασθέντων στοιχείων ὄγκον, ἀλλ’ ἡ τῇ φύσει τοῦ τε ζώου καὶ τοῦ φυτοῦ πρέπουσα. πρέπει δ’ ἔσθ’ ὅτε, τὸ μὲν ὑγρὸν τοῦ ξηροῦ, τὸ δὲ θερμὸν τοῦ ψυχροῦ πλέον ὑπάρχειν. οὐ γὰρ ὁμοίαν χρὴ κρᾶσιν ἔχειν ἄνθρωπον, καὶ λέοντα, καὶ μέλιτταν, καὶ κύνα. πρὸς δὲ τὸν ἐρόμενον, ἧστινός ἐστι κράσεως ἄνθρωπος, ἢ ἵππος, ἢ βοῦς, ἢ κύων, ἢ ὁτιοῦν ἄλλο τῶν πάντων, οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἀποκριτέον. οὐ γὰρ ἐγχωρεῖ τὰ πολλαχῶς λεγόμενά τε καὶ κρινόμενα, καθ’ ἕνα

κράσει τὴν ἴσον ἀπέχουσαν τῶν ἄκρων, ἅ δὴ καὶ πρῶτά τέ εἰσι πάντων καὶ στοιχεῖα. ἴσον δ’ ἀφέξει δηλονότι τῶν ἄκρων, ἐξ ἴσου κερασθέντων ἁπάντων. τὴν οὖν ὑπερβάλλουσαν, ἢ ἐλλείπουσαν τῆσδε, θερμὴν, ἢ

      "openai_translation": "It has been set out by us at great length already concerning this whole manner of using these names, in the second book On the Diagnosis of Pulses. But, as it seems, it is necessary to say something now about them in brief, so far as is useful for the present. What is simply “dry,” said without relation to anything else, belongs only to the elements, to fire and earth; and likewise what is “moist” to water and air. One must think in the same way concerning hot and cold. For none of the other bodies is strictly either hot or cold, but only the elements. Whatever other thing you may take is compounded from these, and for this reason that second sense [of the terms] is no longer “hot” or “cold” absolutely, as though unmixed and pure, but each of the other things is called either hot or cold insofar as it partakes either of more of the hot and less of the cold, or of more of the cold and less of the hot. There are, then, two meanings of “hot and cold” and “dry and moist”: the one, when we speak “simply,” is the unmixed and pure; the other is mixed from contraries, but is designated by the name of the predominating [quality].\n\nThus, for example, blood is called “moist,” as are phlegm, fat, and wine, oil and honey, and each of the other such things. But bones and cartilages, nails, hooves, horns, hairs, stones, wood, sand, and pottery-clay contain a smaller portion of moisture and a larger of dryness, and for this reason all such things are again designated “dry.” An ant is “dry” and a worm “moist,” as living creatures. And again, among worms themselves, this one is drier, that one moister—either generally as “worm,” or compared to some particular other. What precisely do we mean when we say, “a worm is dry,” “a human is hot,” “a dog is cold”? Unless someone first hears and understands exactly, it is inevitable that the entire account be confused. The exact point, which is stated also in the second book On the Diagnosis of Pulses, is that each thing is to be named, at that time, by genus or by species: not merely “hot” or “cold” or “dry” or “moist,” but also “large,” “small,” “slow,” “swift,” and each of such terms, whenever it is beyond the proportionate and the mean—e.g., “a living creature is hot,” whenever a living creature is beyond the mean in its mixture [krâsis, temperament]; or “a horse is hot,” whenever it is beyond the mean horse.\n\nThe means within each genus and species are the proportionate [states]. For they are equally distant from the extremes in that genus and species. Genus, then, is “living creature,” while “horse,” “ox,” and “dog” are species. And indeed, the human being is the mean in mixture with respect to the whole genus of living creatures—for this will be shown in what follows. As for species among humans, the one called “well-fleshed” [eúsarkos] is the mean. This is the one whom we cannot properly call “slender” or “stout,” nor “hot” nor “cold,” nor designate by any of the other names that indicate excess. Whoever is beyond this one is necessarily either hotter or colder or drier or moister. Such a person is named in one way simply, and in another way not simply. Simply, in that he is said to be hot or cold or dry or moist, no longer being compared distinctly to one particular individual. In another way, not simply, in that he is compared to the proportionate and mean of the whole species. Thus also “a dog is a dry animal” is said, as it might seem to someone, simply—no longer being compared, if it happens, to the ant; but in another way, not simply, in that it is compared to the proportionate and mean, in mixture, of the entire species of all living creatures, whatever that may be.\n\nIt has now become evident that, when we speak in this way, we call each thing hot or cold or dry or moist either by comparing it to some one thing whatsoever, or to the mean, according to whatever species or genus is in question—for example: by species, horse, ox, dog, plane-tree, cypress, and fig-tree; by genus, living creature or plant. In addition to these there was a third sense among those said “simply”: those which we declared to have unmixed and extreme qualities, and which are called elements. And we also sometimes give the very qualities themselves [hot, cold, etc.] the same names as the bodies that have them, homonymously. But we shall speak about this shortly. For the present, since qualified bodies [poia sōmata] are spoken of in three ways, it is proper to examine how in each statement one uses the designation—whether indicating something simple and unmixed, or comparing to the proportionate homogeneous or homospecific [same genus or same species], or to any chance thing whatsoever. For instance, when someone says a bone is dry or cold, naming it thus simply without adding “of a lion,” or “of a dog,” or “of a human,” it is evident that, looking to the overall nature of all the bodies in the cosmos, he conceives some mean to which, by comparison, he says it is dry. But if he says that the bone of a lion or of a dog or of a human is dry, it is clear that he again compares it to the mean among the bones of the animals themselves. And it is necessary here too to conceive that among all animals, of which some have drier bones and others moister, there is a mean mixture of bone in some genus of animals—e.g., that of the human, if it so happens—and that other bones, by comparison to this, are called some “moist,” others “dry.” And indeed even among humans themselves one will say that one person has a dry bone, another a moist bone, being compared to the mean as among humans. One must always tacitly understand throughout the whole discussion—even if at times we omit it in wording—that in all things that exist, what is the mean is the proportionate and, relative to that genus or species, the well-mixed [eúkratos].\n\nAccordingly, when someone says that this temperament [krâsis] is moist or hot, one should ask in what way he has spoken—whether by comparing, distinctly, to some one particular thing",

But it seems necessary to say something about them now in summary form, as much as is useful for the present purposes. The simply dry, which is said in relation to nothing else, belongs only to the elements, fire and earth; and indeed the wet belongs to water and air. In the same way one must understand about hot and cold. For none of the other bodies is precisely either hot or cold, but only the elements alone. But whatever else you might take is mixed from these, and therefore the second signification is no longer simply hot or cold, as unmixed and pure, but as participating either in more of the hot and less of the cold, or more of the cold and less of the hot, each of the others is called either hot or cold. \n\nThese then are two significations of hot and cold, and dry and wet: one, when we speak simply, unmixed and pure; the other, mixed from opposites, but named after the predominant quality. Thus blood, phlegm, fat, wine, oil, honey, and each of such things is called wet. But bones, cartilages, nails, hooves, horns, hair, stones, wood, sand, and pottery have a smaller portion of wet and a larger portion of dry, and therefore all such things are again called dry. An ant is dry, and a worm wet, as animals. And again among the worms themselves, this one is drier, that one wetter, either simply as a worm, or compared to some other particular one. \n\nBut what exactly this is, when we speak thus - \"dry as a worm,\" \"hot as a human,\" \"cold as a dog\" - unless one hears and understands precisely beforehand, the entire discussion must necessarily be confused. The precise meaning is what is also stated in the second book On the Diagnosis of Pulses: that each thing is then named according to genus or species, not merely hot or cold or dry or wet, but also large and small, slow and fast, and each such thing, when it exceeds the proportionate and middle state - either a hot animal, when it is an animal above the middle in temperament, or a hot horse, when it is above the middle horse. The middle things in each genus and species are the proportionate ones. For they are equally distant from the extremes in that genus and species. \n\nAnimal is the genus, while horse, ox, and dog are species. And indeed the human is middle in temperament throughout the whole genus of animals - for this will be demonstrated in what follows. The middle human as a species is the one called well-fleshed [eusarkos]. This is the one whom we can call neither thin nor fat, neither hot nor cold, nor name with any other term indicating excess. But whoever exceeds this one is certainly either hotter or colder or drier or wetter. Such a person is named sometimes simply, sometimes not simply. Simply, because he is said to be hot or cold or dry or wet, no longer being compared specifically to this particular one. In another way not simply, because he is compared to the proportionate and middle of the entire species. \n\nThus also a dog is said to be a dry animal simply, as one might think, no longer being compared, if it happens, to an ant; but in another way not simply, because it is compared to the proportionate and middle in temperament of the entire species of all animals, whatever this might be. It has therefore already become clear that when we say each thing spoken of thus is hot or cold or dry or wet, we say it either comparing it to any particular one relative to that, or to the middle, according to whatever species or genus the thing spoken of might be - for example, as a species: horse, ox, dog, plane tree, cypress, fig tree; as a genus: animal or plant. \n\nBeyond these there was a third signification of things spoken simply, which we said have unmixed and extreme qualities, and are named elements. And indeed we sometimes name the qualities themselves homonymously with the qualified bodies. But we will speak about this shortly. For the present, since qualified bodies are spoken of in three ways, one should consider how in each statement someone uses the designation: whether indicating something simple and unmixed, or comparing to the proportionate of the same genus or species, or to anything whatsoever that happens to be at hand.\n\nFor example, when someone says bone is dry or cold, simply naming it thus alone, without adding \"of a lion\" or \"of a dog\" or \"of a human.\" For it is clear that looking to the whole nature of all bodies in the cosmos, he conceives of something middle, to which comparing it he says it is dry. But if he says the bone of a lion or dog or human is dry, it is clear that he again compares it to the middle among the bones of animals themselves. And here too one must conceive that of all animals, some having more dry bones, others less, there is a bone middle in temperament in some genus of animals, for example human if it happens, and the others compared to this are called some wet, some dry. \n\nAnd indeed among humans themselves again, one person will be said to have dry bone, another wet, being compared to the middle as among humans. That the middle of the extremes in all existing things is the proportionate and well-tempered according to that genus or species, one must always understand throughout the entire discussion, even if we sometimes happen to pass over it in expression. \n\nAnd indeed, these things being so, when someone says this temperament is wet or hot, one should ask how he has spoken - whether comparing to some specific individual, as if, for example, comparing Theophrastus to Plato, or according to any genus or species whatsoever. For either as human, or as animal, or as substance simply. For the third signification of each such term, which we said was simple and unmixed, does not exist in mixed things, but in the primary things themselves, which we also call elements. \n\nSo, since each of the qualified bodies is spoken of in three ways, we need only two for the treatise on temperaments: either comparing to anything whatsoever that happens to be at hand, or to the proportionate of the same genus. Since there are many genera, just as there are individuals, the same body will be able to be both hot and cold, and dry and wet in many ways. But when it is compared to any one thing that happens to be at hand, it is quite clear that it is possible for the same thing to be called opposites - for example, Dion drier than Theon and Memnon, but wetter than Ariston and Glaucon. \n\nBut when compared to the proportionate of the same genus or species, here the untrained become confused and disturbed. For the same human can be wet and hot at the same time, and dry and cold: dry and cold when compared to the proportionate human, but wet and hot when compared to some other animal or plant or any substance whatsoever - for example, as to an animal, if it happens, a bee or ant; as to a plant, an olive or fig or laurel; as to some other substance that is neither animal nor plant, like stone or iron or bronze. Among these, comparing to a human is comparison to the same species, while to a bee or ant is to the same genus, and likewise to any plant. For this is a genus higher than animal, just as stone and iron and bronze are from the higher genera. \n\nLet all such comparison be called homogeneous for the sake of brief teaching. Let us only distinguish this much in it: that when some substance is simply said to be well-tempered, and another drier and hotter than this, or colder and wetter, we name the well-tempered one here as that composed of precisely equal opposites coming together, and whatever falls short of or exceeds this in something, we name with the name of what predominates. But when we say any plant or animal is well-tempered, we no longer simply compare opposites to each other in such an arrangement, but make the reference to the nature of the plant or the nature of the animal, saying a fig tree is well-tempered, if it happens, when it is such as the nature most befits a fig tree to be, and likewise a dog, pig, horse, and human, when each of these is in the best condition of its proper nature. \n\nThis very thing - being in the best condition of one's proper nature - is judged by activities. For we say any plant or animal is in the best condition when it functions most excellently. For the excellence of a fig tree is to produce the best and most figs; likewise for the vine, to bear the most and finest grapes; for a horse, to run most swiftly; for a dog, to be extremely spirited for hunting and guarding, but most gentle toward its own people. \n\nAll these things then, both animals and plants I mean, we will say have the best and middle temperament in their own genus not simply when there is precise equality of",

      "openai_translation": "But since this too has now been clearly determined, we must return again to what remains. For if there exists a certain absolute and unmixed quality—of moisture and dryness, and of heat and cold—then whatever bodies have received these [qualities] will be completely and precisely hot and cold and dry and wet. Consider these, then, as the elements [stoicheia: basic constituents] of things that come to be and pass away; the other bodies—those of animals, of plants, and of all inanimate things, such as bronze, iron, stones, and woods—are ranked in the interval between those first [bodies]. For none of them is at the extreme—neither absolutely hot, nor absolutely cold, nor absolutely wet, nor absolutely dry. Rather, either it occupies exactly the middle between the opposites, so as to be no more hot than cold, nor more dry than wet—this will be called simply “well-tempered” [eukraton: in good balance]—or else it has inclined toward one or the other of the extremes, so as to be more hot than cold, or more wet than dry. If, then, it were exactly in the middle in each pair of opposites, so as to be no more hot than cold, nor more dry than wet, this will be called simply well-tempered. But if one side prevails—either with respect to one opposition or to both—then it is no longer well-tempered. If, indeed, it is more hot than cold, it will be called by the name of what it is more of; and likewise with dry and wet; and, correspondingly, if it is more cold, it will be named “cold.” If, however, in each opposition one quality prevails—either hot together with wet, or hot together with dry, or cold together with wet, or cold together with dry—the body will be named according to the quality that predominates. These four dyscrasias [dyskrasiai: imbalances], as we said earlier, are recognized by most physicians and philosophers. But how they leave out the other four that arise as halves of these, as well as the primary mixture of all—the best one—I do not know. Yet that it is possible, when heat predominates, for the mixture to be no more wet than dry, as far as that pairing is concerned, is, I think, evident also from what has already been said. And even if nothing had been said beforehand, it is easiest to infer, once they grant that there is one mixture that is wet-and-hot and another that is dry-and-hot. For if it is not at all necessary that what is hot be invariably dry, but it can also be wet, then clearly an intermediate will also be possible; for the middle is nearer to the dry mixture than the wet [mixture] is. In the same way there is another cold mixture in which cold is the stronger; yet it need not be either wet or dry, but can also be intermediate; for here again you will apply the same argument. Thus, if it is not necessary that the cold be wet, but it can also be dry, it is evident that the middle will also be possible; for this [middle] is nearer to the wet [mixture] than the dry [mixture] is. Therefore, as these two dyscrasias according to the one opposition have been shown—the hot only and the cold—so in the same way there will arise two others according to the other opposition—the dry only and the wet—while heat and cold stand in due proportion to one another. For here again we shall say: just as it is not necessary that a dry mixture be straightway hot, but it may also be cold, so it will not be impossible for there to be one that is neither cold nor hot, but well-tempered in respect of this pair, yet dry in respect of the other opposition. Likewise, a wet mixture need not be either hot or cold, but may be intermediate in both with respect to this opposition. If, then, it is not necessary for the dyscrasia according to hot and cold to be accompanied by that arising from the other opposition, nor for that one to be accompanied by this one, it can sometimes happen that what is well-tempered as regards heat and cold is either dry or wet, and that what is well-tempered in these [wet/dry] is either hot or cold. Hence there are also these four dyscrasias distinct from the former, as the earlier physicians and philosophers have transmitted to us, and these are set in the middle between the well-tempered dispositions and those ill-tempered according to both oppositions. For the perfectly well-tempered has neither opposition",

      "claude_translation": "But since this too has now been clearly defined, we must return again to what remains. For since there exists some pure and unmixed quality—moisture and dryness, heat and cold—whatever bodies have received these will obviously be completely and precisely hot and cold and dry and moist. Understand, then, that these are the elements of things that come to be and perish. But the other bodies—those of animals, plants, and all inanimate things, such as bronze, iron, stones, and wood—are arranged in between those primary ones. For none of them is extremely hot, extremely cold, extremely moist, or extremely dry. Rather, either it is precisely intermediate between the opposites, so as to be no more hot than cold, or dry than moist, or it has inclined toward one of the extremes, so as to be more hot than cold, or more moist than dry.\n\nIf indeed it should be precisely intermediate in each of the oppositions, so as to be no more hot than cold, or dry than moist, this will simply be called well-tempered [eukraton]. But when one predominates, either in one opposition or in both, it is no longer well-tempered. If it should be more hot than cold, it will be called by what it is more of; likewise also dry and moist. In the same way, if it should be more cold, it will be named cold. But if from each opposition one should predominate—either hot and moist together, or hot and dry together, or cold and moist together, or cold and dry together—the body will be named according to what predominates.\n\nThese four dyscrasia [imbalances of temperament], as we said before, most physicians and philosophers recognize. But the other four that arise from half of these, I don't know how they overlook them, just as they do the first temperament of all, the best one. But that it is possible, when heat predominates, for the temperament to be no more moist than dry in this respect, I think is clear even from what has already been said. And it is very easy to reason out, even if nothing had been said before, once they have agreed that one temperament is moist and hot, another dry and hot. For if it is not absolutely necessary for the hot to be dry, but it is possible for it to be moist, clearly it will also be possible for it to be intermediate; for the intermediate is closer to the dry temperament than the moist is.\n\nIn the same way there is another cold temperament in which the cold is stronger; yet it is not necessary for it to be either moist or dry, but it is possible for it to be intermediate. For again here you will apply the same argument. So if it is not necessary for the cold to be moist, but it is possible for it to be dry, it is clear that the intermediate will also be possible, for this is closer to the moist than the dry is.\n\nSo just as these two dyscrasia have been shown with respect to one opposition—one only hot, the other only cold—in the same way two others will arise with respect to the other opposition, one only dry, the other only moist, with the hot and cold being proportionate to each other. For again here we will say, just as it is not necessary that whatever temperament is dry must immediately also be hot, but it can also be cold, it will not be impossible for something to be neither cold nor hot, but well-tempered in this respect, yet dry in the other opposition. Likewise, the moist temperament need not be either hot or cold, but can be intermediate between both in this opposition at least.\n\nIf therefore it is not necessary either for the dyscrasia in cold and hot to be followed by one from the other opposition, nor for that one to be followed by one from this, it is sometimes possible for a nature that is well-tempered with respect to heat and cold to become either dry or moist, and for one well-tempered in these to become either hot or cold. So there are also these four other dyscrasia besides those which the earlier physicians and philosophers handed down to us, and these are arranged as intermediate between the well-tempered conditions and those that are dyskratic in both oppositions.\n\nFor the perfectly well-tempered has neither opposition predominating, while the dyscrasia opposite to this has both bad. In between is that which is well-tempered in one respect but dyskratic in the other, which being half well-tempered and half dyskratic, would properly be called intermediate between the wholly well-tempered and dyskratic.\n\nAnd if these things are so, as indeed they are, we now confidently say that there are nine differences of temperament in all: one well-tempered, and eight not well-tempered—four simple ones (moist, dry, hot, and cold), and four other compound ones (moist and hot together, dry and hot together, cold and moist together, and cold and dry together).",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 8**\n\nBut since this too has now been clearly defined, we must return again to what remains. For since there exists a certain unmixed and unblended quality—wetness and dryness, and hotness and coldness—whatever bodies have received these will evidently be hot and cold and dry and wet completely and precisely. Understand these, then, to be the elements of things that come to be and pass away; and understand the other bodies—those of animals, and of plants, and of all inanimate things, such as bronze, and iron, and stones, and woods—to be ranked in between those primary ones. For none of them is extremely hot, or extremely cold, or extremely wet, or extremely dry. But either it exists exactly in the middle of the opposites, so as to be no more hot than cold, or dry than wet, or it has inclined toward one of the extremes, so as to be more hot than cold, or more wet than dry.\n\nIf, then, it should be exactly in the middle with respect to each of the oppositions, so as to be no more hot than cold, or dry than wet, this will be called simply ‘well-tempered’ [eukraton]. But when one of the two predominates, whether in one opposition or in both, it is no longer well-tempered. If, then, it should be more hot than cold, it will be called by the name of that which is more present; and likewise for dry and wet; and in the same way, if it should be more cold, it will be named cold. But if one quality from each opposition should prevail—either hot and wet at the same time, or hot and dry at the same time, or cold and wet at the same time, or cold and dry at the same time—the body will be named according to the prevailing qualities.\n\nThese four distempers [dyskrasiai], then, as we also said before, most doctors and philosophers recognize. But the other four, which are imbalanced in only one of the two respects, they somehow overlook, as they also do the first and best of all temperaments. But that it is possible, when the hot prevails, for the temperament to be no more wet than dry, insofar as this pair is concerned, is, I think, already evident from what has been said before. And it is very easy to deduce, even if nothing had been said before, once they have conceded one point: that one temperament is wet and hot, and another is dry and hot. For if it is not absolutely necessary for the hot temperament to be dry, but it is possible for it to be wet, it will evidently also be possible for it to be in the middle; for the middle temperament is closer to the dry one than the wet is.\n\nAnd in the same way there is another cold temperament, in which the cold is stronger; yet it is not necessary for it to be either wet or dry, but it is possible for it to become intermediate; for here too you will apply the same argument. So that, if it is not necessary for the cold temperament to be wet, but it is possible for it to become dry, it is evident that it will also be possible for it to be the middle one, for this is closer to the wet than the dry is.\n\nJust as, then, these two distempers were shown to exist with respect to the one opposition—the one merely hot, the other cold—in the same way two others will arise with respect to the other opposition—the one merely dry, the other wet—when the hot and the cold are in due proportion to each other. For here too we shall say again that, just as it is not necessary that any temperament which is dry must immediately also be hot, but it may also be cold, so it will not be impossible for a certain one to be neither cold nor hot, but well-tempered in this respect, while being dry with respect to the other opposition. And likewise, it is not necessary for the wet temperament to be either hot or cold, but it may be intermediate between both, at least with respect to this opposition.\n\nIf, therefore, it is not necessary either for the distemper in respect to hot and cold to be attended by one from the other opposition, or for that one to be attended by this one, it is sometimes possible both for a nature that is well-tempered with respect to hotness and coldness to become either dry or wet, and again for one that is well-tempered in these respects to become either hot or cold. So that there are these four distempers, different from those which earlier doctors and philosophers have handed down to us, and these are to be ranked as intermediate between the well-tempered states and those that are distempered in respect to both oppositions. For the perfectly well-tempered state has neither opposition predominating, while the distempered state at the opposite extreme from this has both in a bad condition. And in the middle is the one which is well-tempered in one opposition but distempered in the other, which, being half well-tempered and half distempered, would properly be said to be intermediate between the wholly well-tempered and the wholly distempered.\n\nAnd if these things are so, as indeed they are, we may now say with confidence that the differences among temperaments are nine in all: one well-tempered, and eight not well-tempered, of which four are simple—wet, and dry, and hot, and cold—and the other four are composite—wet and hot at the same time, and dry and hot at the same time, and cold and wet at the same time, and cold and dry at the same time.",

ἔγγονον. εὐθὺς δ’ ὑπάρχει τῷ τοιούτῳ σώματι, καὶ ταῖς ἐνεργείαις ἄριστα διακεῖσθαι, καὶ σκληρότητός τε καὶ μαλακότητος ἔχειν μετρίως, θερμότητός τε καὶ ψυχρότητος· καὶ ταῦθ’ ὑπάρχειν ἅπαντα τῷ δέρματι, καὶ τούτῳ μάλιστα τῷ τῆς χειρὸς ἐντὸς, ὅταν μηδένα τύλον ἔχῃ τοιοῦτον, οἷον τοῖς ἐρέττουσί τε καὶ σκάπτουσι γίνεται. διττῆς γὰρ ἕνεκα χρείας τῶν χειρῶν γεγενημένων, ἁφῆς καὶ ἀντιλήψεως, αἱ μαλακαὶ μὲν εἰς τὴν τῆς ἁφῆς ἀκρίβειαν, αἱ σκληραὶ δὲ εἰς τὴν τῆς ἀντιλήψεως ἰσχὺν ἐπιτηδειότεραι. καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸ δέρμα τὸ μέσον οὐ μόνον ἁπάντων ἀνθρωπίνων μορίων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς ὅλης οὐσίας, καὶ πάντων τῶν ἐν γενέσει καὶ φθορᾷ σωμάτων, οὐ τὸ τετυλωμένον ἐστὶ καὶ σκληρὸν καὶ λιθῶδες, ἀλλὰ τὸ κατὰ φύσιν ἔχον, ᾧ δὴ καὶ μάλιστά φαμεν ἀκριβοῦσθαι τὴν ἁφήν. ὅτι μὲν οὖν σκληρότητός τε καὶ μαλακότητος ἐν τῷ μέσῳ καθέστηκεν ἁπάντων μορίων, ἱκανῶς ἐναργές· ὅτι δὲ καὶ θερμότητος καὶ ψυχρότητος, ἐκ τῆς οὐσίας ἂν αὐτοῦ μάλιστα καταμάθοις. ἔστι γὰρ οἷον ἔναιμόν τι νεῦρον, ἀκριβῶς μέσον ὑπάρχον νεύρου τε καὶ σαρκὸς, ὡς εἰ καὶ κραθέντων ἀμφοῖν ἐγένετο. ἀλλὰ νεῦρον μὲν ἅπαν ἄναιμόν τε καὶ ψυχρόν· σὰρξ δὲ πολύαιμός τε καὶ θερμή· μέσον δ’ ἀμφοῖν τὸ δέρμα, μήτ’ ἄναιμον τὸ πάμπαν, ὡς νεῦρον, ἀλλὰ μηδὲ

ἧττον δὲ αὐτῆς ὀστοῦν ψυχρόν ἐστι καὶ ξηρὸν, καὶ τοῦδε χόνδρος ἧττον ξηρός. ἐφεξῆς δὲ χόνδρῳ σύνδεσμος, καὶ ὃν χονδροσύνδεσμον ὀνομάζουσιν, ἔπειτα τένων, εἶθ’ ὑμὴν, καὶ ἀρτηρία, καὶ φλὲψ, αὐτὰ δηλονότι τὰ σώματα τῶν ἀγγείων, εἶθ’ ὅσα νεῦρα σκληρά. τὰ δὲ μαλακὰ νεῦρα κατὰ τὴν τοῦ δέρματος ὑπάρχει φύσιν ἐν τῇ καθ’ ὑγρότητά τε καὶ ξηρότητα μεσότητι. κατὰ γὰρ τὴν ἑτέραν ἀντίθεσιν οὐκ ἔτι μέσον θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ τὸ νεῦρον μαλακὸν, ἀλλὰ τοσοῦτον ἀπολείπεται θερμότητος, ὅσον καὶ αἵματος. οὕτω δὲ καὶ τἄλλα σύμπαντα τὰ πρόσθεν εἰρημένα τοσούτῳ ψυχρότερα δέρματος, ὅσῳ καὶ ἀναιμότερα. καὶ οἵ γε χιτῶνες αὐτοὶ τῶν ἐναιμοτάτων ἀγγείων, ἀρτηρίας λέγω καὶ φλεβὸς, ἄναιμοί τέ εἰσι καὶ ψυχροὶ τῇ φύσει· τῇ γειτνιάσει δὲ τοῦ αἵματος θερμαίνονται, καὶ εἰς μέσην ἀφικνοῦνται κατάστασιν κράσεως. τὸ δὲ

      "openai_translation": "In each of the mixtures just described, the more and the less are exceedingly manifold—both in the so‑called simple mixtures and in regard to the whole substance, and indeed also in any single genus whatsoever. If someone wishes to be a diagnostician of mixtures, he ought to begin his training with the well‑balanced [eukratic] and middling natures in each several genus. By comparing the others to these, he will readily discover in each case what exceeds or what is deficient.\n\nFirst, then, we must speak about those that are simply called well‑mixed [well‑balanced] and ill‑mixed [ill‑balanced], which, we said, are examined in every generated substance, not only in animals or plants. And here again we must at least make so much distinction about the terms: that a hot mixture is one thing in actuality, and another in potentiality; and that we call “in potentiality” those things which are not yet what is asserted of them, but can most easily become so, having by nature a certain suitability toward becoming so. Let us therefore first go through those that are actually hot and cold, and dry and moist, beginning from total substance, and then move on to animals and plants. For in this way what we proposed would be accomplished for us in a complete manner.\n\nSince, then, the mean in every genus, and most of all in total substances, comes to be from the blending of the extremes, our conception and diagnosis of it must also be constituted from those extremes. The conceptual apprehension is the easier. Starting from what is the hottest of all things that come within sense—say fire, or some water boiling to the utmost—and descending to the coldest of all we know—say crystal or snow—when we have conceived some interval, we cut it exactly in the middle. Thus we shall discover by thought the proportionate mean, which is at an equal remove from each of the extremes. Moreover, we can in a way even produce it, by mixing an equal volume of crystal with boiling water; for what has been tempered from both will be equally removed from each of the extremes, from that which burns and from that which benumbs through cold. Therefore, after touching what has been mixed in this way, there is no further difficulty in possessing the mean of total substance in the opposition of hot and cold, in remembering it, and in judging all other things by comparing them, as to some rule.\n\nIn the same way, if you stir dry earth, or ash, or some other precisely parched thing with water in equal volume, you will produce a body that is the mean in the opposition of dry and moist. Here too, then, there is no difficulty: once we have discerned such a body at once by sight and by touch, we lay it up in memory and use this as a rule and criterion for diagnosing excesses and deficiencies of moisture and dryness.\n\nLet, to be sure, the body under judgment be proportionately warm. For if it is brought to the extreme either of heat or of cold, this mean body of moist and dry will at times present a false appearance: it will seem sometimes more moist than proportionate, sometimes more dry. For if it is heated beyond what is fitting, as it melts and flows it will present the appearance of being more moist. If, however, it is cooled beyond what is appropriate, it sets and congeals and becomes immobile, and to the touch appears hard; and from this it projects a false appearance of dryness. But if, just as it partook equally of moist and dry, it were also in the mean of heat and cold, such a body would appear to the toucher neither hard nor soft.\n\nNow to mix the whole through the whole—the hot and the cold, and the dry and the moist—is impossible for a human being. Earth kneaded with water is, to be sure, mixed, as it might seem to someone, and is so blended that each is everywhere with each; but such a thing is juxtaposition in small particles, not a through‑and‑through mixture; for blending whole through whole is the work of god and nature. Even more would this be the case if the hot and the cold were to be blended whole through whole with each other. To produce, however, such a juxtaposition as makes each of the simple bodies escape detection by the senses—this is not the work of nature or god alone; it is ours as well. For it is not difficult to produce a mean of moist and dry, a clay, from such a mixing; and likewise a mean of hot and cold. Such a body will appear to you well‑balanced in respect of heat and cold, and also in the mean of hardness and softness. Of such a kind too is human skin: exactly the mean of all the extremes—of hot and cold, and of hard and soft—and most of all that of the hand. For this was destined to be the gauge of all sensibles, a tactile instrument fashioned by nature as proper to the most intelligent of animals. It had to be equally distant from all the extremes—hot and cold, and dry and moist. And indeed it has come to be from an equal share of all these, not merely being mixed, but blended whole through whole with one another—something none of us is able to achieve, but which is the work of nature.\n\nThose parts that are harder than the skin—bones, cartilages, horns, hairs, nails, ligaments, shields [protective plates], and “plectra” [callus‑like hardenings]—contain more of the dry; while those that are softer—blood, phlegm, fat, suet, marrow, brain and spinal cord—contain more of the moist than of the dry. And by just as much as the driest part in a human being exceeds the skin in dryness, by so much in turn does the moistest fall short. The discussion already seems to be touching on things most useful and to be teaching that the human being is the most well‑balanced not only among animals but of all other bodies as well; and at the same time that the skin of the hand, the inner surface, has precisely escaped all excesses of every kind. Having paused here again, let us examine what human being is best mixed of all—whom we must set in the mean of the whole substance and even more so among humans and the other animals, as a kind of rule and gauge; by comparing all the others to this one, we may call them hot or cold, and dry or moist.\n\nMany marks must concur in the same person for this. For to one who examines with respect to total substance, such a person must appear in the mean, and even more so with respect to humans and animals. The marks common to total substance have been set forth above; but as regards forms of animals, the judgment lies in the completeness of the activity appropriate to each. It befits a human being to be most wise; a dog to be at once most gentle and most bold; a lion to be boldest only, as likewise a sheep to be gentlest. And it has also been shown, in Aristotle’s On the Parts of Animals and no less by us, that the activities of the body ought to be appropriate to the character of the soul.\n\nSuch, then, is the method. But to be trained to recognize readily, in each genus of animal and with respect to the whole, the mean—not by any chance person, but by one who is extremely painstaking and, through long experience and much knowledge of all the particulars, is able to discover the mean—this is the task. In just this way sculptors and painters and makers of statues, in general, produce the finest forms in each kind—say the most well‑formed human, horse, ox, or lion—by looking to the mean in that genus. And there is a certain statue that is praised, called the Canon of Polycleitus, having acquired its name from the exact proportion of all the parts to one another. What we are now seeking, however, goes beyond that canon. For the man thus well‑fleshed stands in the mean not only of moisture and dryness, but has also attained the best formation—perhaps following upon the well‑balanced mixture of the four elements, or perhaps having some other more divine principle from above. In any case, that such a man is altogether well‑balanced is necessarily the case; for the proportion in good flesh is the offspring of well‑balanced mixture. Straightway, too, it belongs to such a body to be in the best condition with respect to its activities, and to possess a measured degree of hardness and softness, and of heat and",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 9:**\n\nIn each of the aforementioned temperaments, the degree of more and less varies greatly, both in what are called the simple temperaments and in the whole substance, and indeed in any single genus. If someone wishes to become skilled in diagnosing temperaments, it is fitting for him to begin his training from the well-tempered and intermediate natures in each genus. For by comparing the others to these, he will easily discover what is excessive or deficient in each. We must therefore first speak about those simply called well-tempered and ill-tempered, which we said are examined in every generated substance, not only in animals or plants. But here again we must make this distinction about names: that a hot temperament is one thing in actuality, another in potentiality, and we say things exist potentially which are not yet what they are said to be, but for which it is very easy to become so, possessing some natural aptitude for becoming. Let us therefore first discuss those that are actually hot and cold, and dry and moist, beginning from the whole substance, and then proceed to animals and plants. For thus our proposed task would be completely accomplished.\n\nSince, then, the mean in every genus, and especially in whole substances, comes from the mixture of extremes, both its conception and diagnosis must be established from these. The conception is quite easy. For descending from the hottest of all things that come to perception, such as fire or some water boiling extremely, to the coldest of all we know, like ice or snow, and conceiving some interval, we divide this exactly in the middle. For thus we will discover by conception the moderate point, which is equidistant from each extreme. But we can also somehow construct it by mixing equal volumes of ice with boiling water. For what is mixed from both will be equidistant from each extreme, from what burns and what numbs through cold. It is therefore no longer difficult, having touched what is thus mixed, to have the mean of every substance in the opposition between hot and cold, and to remember this, and judge all other things by comparing them to it as to some standard.\n\nMoreover, if you moisten dry earth, or ash, or some other such thing that is perfectly parched, with water equal in volume, you will produce the middle body in the opposition between dry and moist. Therefore, neither is it difficult here, having diagnosed such a body by both sight and touch, to store it in memory and use it as a standard and criterion for diagnosing moist and dry things that are deficient or excessive. Let the body being judged be moderately warm, obviously. For if it were brought to an extreme of either heat or cold, this middle body of moist and dry would sometimes present a false appearance, and would seem sometimes moister than moderate, sometimes drier. For if heated more than necessary, melting and flowing, it will present an appearance of being moister than itself. But cooling beyond what is appropriate, it stands still and congeals, becomes motionless, and appears hard to those touching it, and from this projects a false appearance of dryness. But if, just as it partakes equally of moist and dry, so it is also intermediate between heat and cold, such a body appears neither hard nor soft to one touching it.\n\nNow to mix these things through and through with each other—I mean hot and cold, and dry and moist—is impossible for a human. For earth mixed with moisture is indeed mixed, as one might think, and thus everything is blended with everything, but such a thing is juxtaposition in small parts, not mixture through and through, but to mix both through and through is the work of god and nature. Still more so if hot and cold were to be mixed through and through with each other. However, to create such a juxtaposition that each of the simple bodies escapes perception is not the work of nature alone or god, but is also ours. For it is not difficult to create mud as a mean between moist and dry from such a mixture; likewise also between hot and cold. And such a body will appear to you well-tempered in both heat and cold, and also intermediate between hardness and softness.\n\nSuch is also human skin, exactly intermediate between all extremes, hot and cold, hard and soft, and especially that on the hand. For this was destined to be the judge of all perceptible things, having been fashioned by nature as a tactile organ appropriate to the most intelligent of animals. It was therefore necessary for it to be equidistant from all extremes, hot and cold, dry and moist. And indeed it has come to be from an equal share of all these, not merely mixed, but blended through and through with each other, which none of us is any longer able to accomplish, but is the work of nature.\n\nTherefore, whatever parts are harder than skin, such as bones, cartilages, horns, hair, nails, ligaments, hooves, and spurs, have more of the dry in them; but whatever are softer, such as blood, phlegm, fat, suet, marrow, brain and spinal cord, have more moisture in them than dryness. And indeed, by as much as the driest part in a human exceeds the skin in dryness, by so much again does the moistest fall short. The argument seems somehow already to touch upon the most useful matters, teaching both that humans are the most well-tempered not only of animals but of all other bodies, and that among their parts the skin of the inner hand has precisely escaped all extremes.\n\nHaving paused here again in our discussion, let us examine which human is best tempered of all, whom we must place in the middle of the whole substance, and still more of humans and other animals, and using him as a standard and judge, compare all others to him, calling them hot and cold, dry and moist. Many signs must coincide in such a person. For examining him in relation to the whole substance, such a person must appear intermediate, and still more so in relation to humans and animals. The common signs of all substance have been mentioned before; but those among animal species are judged by the perfection of activity appropriate to each. It is fitting for a human to be most wise, for a dog to be both most gentle and brave, for a lion to be only most brave, as for a sheep to be most gentle.\n\nAnd that bodily activities must be appropriate to the character of the soul has been shown by Aristotle in his work on the parts of animals; and we have spoken about these matters no less. This then is the method. But to train oneself to readily recognize the mean in each genus of animal and in all things is not the work of an ordinary man, but of one extremely industrious, able through long experience and much knowledge to discover the mean in all particulars. Thus sculptors, painters, statue-makers, and generally all who make images paint and sculpt the most beautiful in each species—the most handsome human, or horse, or ox, or lion—aiming at the mean in that genus. And somewhere a statue is praised, called Polyclitus's Canon, having received such a name from having exact proportion of all parts to each other.\n\nNow what we are seeking is more extensive than this Canon. For the human thus well-fleshed stands not only in the middle of moisture and dryness, but has also obtained the best formation, perhaps following upon the good temperament of the four elements, but perhaps having some other more divine principle from above. But that such a person is altogether well-tempered necessarily exists; for moderate fleshiness is the offspring of good temperament. Immediately such a body is also best disposed in its activities, and is moderate in both hardness and softness, heat and cold; and all these belong to the skin, and especially to that on the inside of the hand, when it has no such callus as develops in rowers and diggers. For since hands were generated for a double use, touch and grasping, soft ones are more suitable for precision of touch, hard ones for strength of grasp.\n\nAnd indeed the intermediate skin—not only of all human parts but of the whole substance and all bodies in generation and corruption—is not the calloused and hard and stony one, but that which is according to nature, by which we especially say touch is made precise. That it stands in the middle of hardness and softness of all parts is sufficiently clear; and that it is also intermediate in heat and cold, you would especially understand from its substance. For it is like some blood-filled nerve, being exactly intermediate between nerve and flesh, as if generated from both being mixed. But every nerve is bloodless and cold; flesh is full of blood and warm; skin is intermediate between both, being neither completely bloodless like nerve, nor full of blood like flesh.\n\nIf then, setting this up as a standard and criterion of all the animal's parts, you examine and compare the others to it, you will find the eight differences of dyscrasia [bad temperament] in them. And I will go through all of them for you in detail in order. Phlegm is moistest and coldest, blood is hottest but not as moist",

      "gemini_translation": "Here is the translation of the provided Ancient Greek paragraph.\n\n**Paragraph 9:**\n\nIn each of the aforementioned temperaments, the degree of ‘more’ and ‘less’ is immense, both with respect to the so-called simple temperaments and with respect to the substance as a whole, and indeed also within any single class of things. Therefore, if anyone wishes to be skilled in diagnosing temperaments, it is proper for him to begin his training with the well-tempered and intermediate natures within each class. For by comparing the others to these, he will easily discover the excess or deficiency in each one. First, therefore, we must speak of the temperaments that are called simply ‘well-tempered’ and ‘ill-tempered,’ which, as we have said, are to be investigated in every created substance, not only in animals or plants.\n\nAnd here again, we must make at least this distinction concerning terms: that a hot temperament in actuality [ἐνεργείᾳ] is one thing, and in potentiality [δυνάμει] another. We say that things exist in potentiality which are not yet what they are said to be, but for which it is very easy to become so, possessing a certain natural aptitude for coming into being. Let us, then, first discuss those things that are hot and cold, and dry and moist, in actuality, beginning from substance as a whole, and then let us move on to animals and plants. For in this way our proposed task would be perfectly completed.\n\nSince, therefore, the mean in every class—and especially with respect to substances as a whole—arises from the mixture of the extremes, it is necessary that our conception and diagnosis of it also be constructed from them. The matter of conception is quite easy. For by descending from the hottest of all things that come to our perception—such as fire, or some water at a full boil—to the coldest of all things we know—such as ice or snow—and conceiving of some interval, we cut this exactly in the middle. For in this way we shall discover by conception the symmetrical point, which is equidistant from each of the extremes. But we can also construct it in a way, by mixing an equal volume of ice with boiling water. For the substance blended from both will be equidistant from each of the extremes: that which burns and that which numbs through cold. It is, therefore, no longer difficult, by touching what has been so blended, to grasp the mean of all substance in the opposition of hot and cold, and to remember this, and to judge all other things by comparing them to it as to a kind of standard [κανόνι].\n\nAnd indeed, by stirring dry earth, or ash, or some other such thing that is perfectly parched, with an equal volume of water, you will produce the mean body of the opposition between dry and moist. Therefore, here too there is no difficulty; having diagnosed such a body by sight and touch together, one can commit it to memory and use it as a standard and criterion for the diagnosis of things that are deficient or excessive in moisture and dryness. Let it be clear, of course, that the body being judged is moderately hot. For if this mean body of moist and dry were brought to an extreme of either heat or cold, it would sometimes give a false impression, and would seem at one time to be moister than the mean, and at another, drier. For if it were heated more than it should be, by melting and flowing it would give the impression of being moister than it is. But if cooled beyond what is proper, it stands still and solidifies, becomes immobile, and appears hard to the touch, and from this it projects a false impression of dryness. But if, just as it partook equally of moist and dry, it were also in the mean of heat and cold, such a body would appear neither hard nor soft to the touch.\n\nNow, to blend them—I mean the hot and the cold, and the dry and the moist—whole through whole is impossible for a human being. For earth kneaded with a liquid is mixed, as one might think, and so is blended all with all; yet such a thing is a juxtaposition [παράθεσις] of tiny particles, and not a blending through and through [δι’ ὅλων κρᾶσις]. Rather, to blend both through and through is the work of God and of Nature. This is even more the case if the hot and the cold were to be blended whole through whole with each other. However, to produce such a juxtaposition that each of the simple bodies escapes perception is not the work of Nature or God alone, but is ours as well. For it is not difficult to make a clay that is a mean of moist and dry from such a mixture, and likewise of hot and cold. And such a body will appear to you to be well-tempered in its heat and cold, but also in the mean of hardness and softness.\n\nSuch also is the skin of human beings, precisely in the mean of all the extremes—of hot and cold, and of hard and soft—and especially the skin on the hand. For this was destined to be the measure [γνώμων] of all perceptible things, having been crafted by Nature as the organ of touch proper to the most intelligent of animals. It was necessary, therefore, for it to be equidistant from all the extremes: hot and cold, and dry and moist. And indeed it has been formed from an equal portion of all these, not only mixed together but also blended through and through with one another—a feat which none of us can any longer accomplish, but which is the work of Nature.\n\nNow, all the parts that are harder than the skin—such as bones, cartilages, horns, hair, nails, ligaments, hooves, and spurs—in these the dry is in excess. But all those that are softer—such as blood, phlegm, soft fat [πιμελή], hard fat [στέαρ], marrow (both cerebral and spinal)—in these there is more of the moist than of the dry. And indeed, by as much as the driest part in a human being exceeds the skin in dryness, by so much again does the moistest part fall short of it. The discussion now seems to be touching upon the most useful points themselves, teaching at once that man is the most well-tempered not only of animals but of all other bodies, and that among the parts within him, the skin on the inside of the hand has precisely escaped all excesses.\n\nLet us, therefore, pause our discussion here again and consider who is the best-tempered of all human beings. We must place him in the mean, not only of all substance but even more so of humans and other animals, and, using him as a kind of standard and measure, we should name all others hot, cold, dry, or moist by comparison to him. And for this person, many distinguishing marks must coincide. For he must appear to be in the mean when examined in relation to all substance, and even more so in relation to humans and animals. Now, the distinguishing marks for all substance in common have been stated before; but those within the classes of animals are judged by the perfection of the activity proper to each. It is proper for a man to be most wise, for a dog to be most gentle and at the same time most courageous, for a lion to be only most courageous, just as for a sheep to be most gentle. And indeed, that the activities of the body must be suited to the character of the soul has been shown by Aristotle in his *Parts of Animals*, and has been discussed by us no less.\n\nThis, then, is the method. But to practice recognizing readily the mean in each class of animal and in all things universally is not the task of an ordinary man, but belongs to one who is exceedingly diligent and who, through long experience and great knowledge of all the particulars, is able to discover the mean. In this way, for instance, modelers, painters, sculptors of statues, and image-makers in general paint and sculpt the most beautiful examples of each type—such as a most well-formed man, or horse, or ox, or lion—by looking for the mean within that class. And a certain statue is praised, called the *Canon* of Polyclitus, which earned such a name from having the exact proportion [συμμετρίαν] of all its parts to one another.\n\nThe man we are now seeking, however, is something more than this *Canon*. For not only is such a well-fleshed man situated in the mean of moisture and dryness, but he has also attained the best physical form—perhaps as a consequence of the well-tempered mixture [εὐκρασίᾳ] of the four elements, or perhaps having some other, more divine principle from above. But it is in any case necessary that such a man be perfectly well-tempered; for the right proportion in fleshiness is an offspring of a good temperament. And it follows at once that such a body is in the best condition for its activities, and possesses a moderate degree of hardness and softness, and of heat and cold. And all these qualities belong to the skin, and especially to the skin on the inside of the hand, when it has no callus of the sort that develops on those who row or dig. For since the hands have come into being for a dual purpose, touch and grasping, soft hands are better suited for precision of touch, while hard hands are better for strength in grasping. And indeed, the skin that is the mean not only of all human parts but of all substance and of all bodies subject to generation and corruption, is not the calloused, hard, and stony kind, but that which is in its natural state, by which we say touch is made most precise.\n\nThat it is situated in the mean of hardness and softness among all parts is sufficiently clear; that it is also in the mean of heat and cold, you might best learn from its substance. For it is like a blood-filled sinew, existing precisely in the mean between sinew and flesh, as if it had been created from a blending of the two. But all sinew is bloodless and cold, whereas flesh is full of blood and hot; the skin is the mean of both, being neither entirely bloodless like sinew, nor yet full of blood like flesh. If, then, you set this up as a standard and a kind of criterion for all the parts of the animal and you examine and compare the others to it, you will find the eight variations of distemperament in them. And indeed, I will go through them all for you in order in detail.\n\nPhlegm, then, is the moistest and coldest; blood is the hottest, but not as moist as phlegm. Hair is the driest and coldest. Bone is less cold and dry than hair, and cartilage is less dry than bone. In order after cartilage comes ligament, and what they call chondro-ligament, then tendon, then membrane, and artery, and vein—that is, the very bodies of the vessels—then all the hard nerves. The soft nerves, however, have a nature like that of the skin in their mean state with respect to moisture and dryness. For in the other opposition, a soft nerve is no longer in the mean of hot and cold, but is as deficient in heat as it is in blood. And in this way, all the other parts mentioned before are colder than the skin in proportion to how much more bloodless they are. And the very tunics of the most blood-filled vessels—I mean the artery and the vein—are themselves bloodless and cold by nature; but by their proximity to the blood they are warmed and arrive at a mean state of temperament. The blood itself, in turn, has its heat from the heart. For that organ is by nature the most blood-filled and at the same time the hottest of all the parts of the animal; next after it is the liver. But the heart falls little short of the skin in hardness, whereas the liver falls far short. And accordingly, the liver is moister than the skin in proportion to how much softer it is.\n\nAnd what is more, flesh is moister than skin; but it is also hotter. The spinal marrow is moister, but also colder; and the brain is moister than this, and even moister still is soft fat [πιμελή] and its congealed form, due to its proximity to the membranes. For it resembles thick oil, and for this reason it congeals when in contact with cold and bloodless parts. It is not possible for soft fat to congeal around the liver, or the arteries and veins, or the heart, nor indeed around any other very hot part. Because it congeals in a very cold environment, it melts when heated, just like other congealed things. The brain, however, does not melt when heated, and for this reason it is less moist than soft fat. The flesh of the lung is also less moist than soft fat, for it too does not melt when heated. And much less moist than soft fat is the flesh of the spleen and of the kidneys. All of these, however, are moister than the skin.\n\nI will explain the proofs for these things in the course of my argument; and indeed, whatever is lacking in this entire treatise on temperaments will be stated in the following two commentaries.",

      "openai_translation": "That “moist” and “dry” body, and “hot” and “cold,” are among terms said in many ways was distinguished in the preceding discussion. And it has been shown that there are nine differences of mixtures [kraseis: blends of elemental qualities]: one is proportionate and well-tempered [eukratos, summetros], while all the remaining are ill-tempered [dyskraoi]: four are simple, in each of which one quality predominates—either heat, or cold, or dryness, or moisture; and four are composite, when in each pair of opposites the one power prevails. I call two pairs “opposites”: one according to hot and cold, the other according to dry and moist. Proceeding next from these to the diagnostic marks, we shall examine the well-tempered nature, because this is first of all in excellence, in power, and in order of understanding.\n\nSince “well-tempered” is found said in two ways—one, simply, throughout the whole of nature, and another, differently for each genus—it seemed right to investigate first that which is examined in common for all nature. Its rule and criterion is the equal-share of the elements [isomoiria], by which the exact middle of all extremes, when achieved, is called “well-tempered” and “proportionate.” The other well-tempered states in each several genus are judged by the proper activities and uses of the bodies.\n\nAnd for this reason the same body of some animal or plant can be the mean among all of its homogeneous kind—that is, well-tempered and proportionate in that genus—yet be ill-tempered when compared with some other genus, whether of plants or animals or inanimate things. For the body of a living being, compared with that of a dead one, is moister and hotter. For example, if it so happens, a living lion than a dead lion, or the very same individual than himself [when dead], or one than another, is hotter and moister. And thus it has been said by the ancients that the living creature is moist and hot—not as if either moisture or heat simply predominated in it. For if so, very many animals would be found cold and dry, such as bed-bugs and gnats, and flies, and bees, and ants—but in comparison with the dead. For a living bee is both moister and hotter than a dead bee, and an ant than an ant. Yet when compared with a human being, a horse, an ox, and the other blooded animals [ennaima], all such creatures are cold and dry in mixture.\n\nAnd even if you look to the total substance, not even then has their being dry and cold been abandoned. For just as in each genus, whenever something departs from the mean, it is named from that which predominates, in the same way with respect to the whole substance, whenever something exceeds the mean, it will no longer be called well-tempered, but will be named either cold, or dry, or hot, or moist. For it has already been shown that the human being is the most well-tempered not only among animals or plants, but among all other things",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation:**\n\nThat \"moist\" and \"dry\" body, and \"hot\" and \"cold\" are among things spoken of in many ways has been distinguished in the preceding discourse. It has been demonstrated that there are nine differences of temperaments [kraseis]: one that is proportionate and well-tempered, while all the rest are ill-tempered—four simple ones, with one quality predominating in each (either heat, coldness, dryness, or moisture), and four others, when from each opposition one power prevails over the other. I speak of two oppositions: one according to hot and cold, the other according to dry and moist.\n\nFollowing these points, we turned to the identifying marks and examined the well-tempered nature, because this is first of all in excellence, power, and order of conception. Since \"well-tempered\" is found spoken of in one way simply in all the nature of existing things, but differently in each genus, it seemed necessary to investigate first what is examined commonly throughout all nature. The standard and criterion of this was the equal proportion of the elements, through which what is accomplished as precisely the mean of all extremes is called well-tempered and proportionate. The other things that are well-tempered according to each genus are judged by the proper activities and functions of bodies.\n\nFor this reason, the same body of some animal or plant can be the mean of all its congeners—that is, well-tempered and proportionate in that genus—yet ill-tempered when compared to some other genus of plants, animals, or inanimate things. For the body of a living thing, when compared to that of a dead one, is moister and warmer. For example, if it happens, a living lion compared to a dead lion, or someone compared to himself, or one to another, is warmer and moister. For this reason it has been said by the ancients that an animal is moist and warm—not as if moisture or heat simply predominates in it. For in this way many animals would be found to be cold and dry, such as gnats, mosquitoes, flies, bees, and ants—but rather as compared to dead ones. For a living bee is moister and warmer than a dead bee, and an ant than an ant. However, when compared to humans, horses, oxen, and other blooded animals, all such creatures are cold and dry in temperament.\n\nMoreover, even if you examine them looking at their whole substance, they do not thereby fall outside of being dry and cold. For just as in each genus, when something deviates from the mean, it is named from what predominates, in the same way regarding the whole of substance, when something exceeds the mean, it will no longer be called well-tempered, but either cold, dry, hot, or moist. For it has been demonstrated previously that humans are the most well-tempered not only of animals or plants, but of all other things.\n\nSince [the human] is composed of many different parts, it is clear that what is the mean of all in temperament, this is also simply the most well-tempered. For the middle part of an animal that is middle in temperament is simply the most well-tempered of all. This was shown to be in humans what is called the skin, and especially the inner part of the hands' skin, if it remains as nature has fashioned it. And indeed, as was said before, not every human's skin is simply the mean of all substance, but only whoever is most well-tempered; for there is great difference among humans themselves.\n\nThe most well-tempered person is whoever appears in body to be precisely the mean between extremes—of thinness and thickness, softness and hardness, and furthermore of heat and coldness. For one can find by touching each human body either a good and vaporous warmth, or a fiery and sharp one, or neither of these but some prevailing coldness. One must understand \"prevailing coldness\" as in an animal's body, and indeed one that is blooded and moist. Such then in body is the well-tempered human.\n\nSimilarly in soul, he is precisely the mean between boldness and cowardice, hesitation and rashness, pity and envy. Such a person would be cheerful, affectionate, humane, and intelligent. From these things the most well-tempered human is recognized primarily and especially. Not a few necessary consequences follow these characteristics. For he eats and drinks moderately, and digests foods well, not only in the stomach but also in the veins and throughout the whole constitution of the body, and, to speak concisely, he has all the so-called natural functions and psychic ones faultless. For he is excellently disposed in his senses and in the movements of his limbs, is always of good color and good breathing, and is the mean between drowsy and sleepless, between hairless and hairy, between dark and fair in complexion. He has hair that, as a child, is rather reddish than black, but the opposite when mature.",

      "gemini_translation": "That the terms ‘moist’ and ‘dry’ body, and ‘hot’ and ‘cold’, are used in many different senses has been established in the preceding discourse. And it has been demonstrated that there are nine different temperaments [Greek: *kraseis*]: one that is balanced and well-tempered [*eukratos*], and all the rest ill-tempered [*dyskratos*]. Four of these are simple, with one quality predominating in each—namely heat, cold, dryness, or moistness—and another four are compound, arising when one power from each of the two oppositions prevails. I speak of two oppositions: one between hot and cold, and the other between dry and moist. Following this, we moved on to the characteristic signs and examined the well-tempered nature, because it is first among all of them in excellence, in power, and in the order of our understanding.\n\nBut since the term ‘well-tempered’ is used in one sense absolutely, with respect to the whole of nature, and in another sense relatively, within each genus, it seemed necessary to first examine that which is considered in a universal sense throughout all nature. The standard and criterion for this was the equal proportion of the elements, on account of which that which is constituted as the precise mean of all the extremes is called well-tempered and balanced. The other things that are well-tempered within each genus, however, are judged by the proper functions [*energeiai*] and needs of those bodies. For this reason, the very same body of an animal or plant can be the mean among all those of its own kind—that is, well-tempered and balanced within that genus—but ill-tempered when compared to some other genus of plants, animals, or inanimate things. For the body of a living creature, when compared to that of a dead one, is moister and hotter. For example, a living lion is hotter and moister than a dead lion, or any given person is hotter and moister than his own corpse, or one person than another [when one is living and the other dead]. And for this reason it was said by the ancients that a living creature is moist and hot—not in the sense that moistness or heat absolutely predominates in it. For if that were the case, a great many animals would be found to be cold and dry, such as gnats, mosquitoes, flies, bees, and ants; rather, it is meant in comparison with the dead. For a living bee is moister and hotter than a dead bee, and an ant than a dead ant.\n\nWhen compared, however, to a human, a horse, an ox, and other blooded animals, all such creatures are cold and dry in their temperament. And indeed, even if you were to examine them with a view to substance as a whole, they would not cease to be considered dry and cold. For just as within each genus, when something deviates from the mean, it is named after the quality that is in excess, so too with respect to substance as a whole: when something exceeds the mean, it will no longer be called well-tempered, but will be named either cold, or dry, or hot, or moist.\n\nFor it has been demonstrated previously that man is the most well-tempered not only of animals and plants, but of all other things whatsoever. And since he is composed of many different parts, it is evident that the part that is the mean of all of them in its temperament is also the most well-tempered in an absolute sense. For the mean part of the creature that is the mean in temperament is, absolutely, the most well-tempered of all things. And this, in man, was shown to be what is called the skin, and especially the skin on the inside of the hands, provided it is preserved in the state in which it was fashioned by nature.\n\nAnd indeed it was also stated previously that the skin of not just any man is the absolute mean of all substance, but only of the man who is most well-tempered; for there is great variation even among human beings themselves. The most well-tempered man is he who, in his body, appears to be the precise mean between the extremes: of thinness and stoutness, of softness and hardness, and moreover of heat and cold. For by touching human bodies, one can find in each either a gentle and vaporous warmth, or a fiery and acrid heat, or neither of these but rather a certain prevailing coldness. (One must, of course, understand ‘prevailing coldness’ in the context of an animal’s body, and a blooded and moist one at that.) Such, then, with respect to the body, is the well-tempered man.\n\nLikewise, in his soul, he is the precise mean between rashness and cowardice, hesitation and impetuosity, and pity and envy. Such a man would be cheerful, affectionate, benevolent, and intelligent. It is from these characteristics that the most well-tempered man is primarily and especially recognized. But to these are added not a few necessary consequences. For he eats and drinks in moderation and digests his food well, not only in the stomach but also in the veins and throughout the entire constitution [*hexis*] of his body. And, to put it concisely, he possesses all the so-called natural and psychic functions in a faultless state. For he is in an excellent state with regard to his senses and the movements of his limbs; he always has a good complexion and breathes easily; he is a mean between the sleepy and the sleepless, the hairless and the hairy, and the black-skinned and the white. As for his hair, when he is a boy it is more reddish than black, but in his prime, the reverse.",

καὶ ἀρτηρίαις, καὶ φλεψὶ, καὶ νεύροις, καὶ χιτῶσι, καὶ σαρξί. καὶ δικαίως Ἀριστοτέλης εἰκάζει τὸ γῆρας αὐαινομένῳ φυτῷ. καὶ γὰρ οὖν καὶ τὰ φυτὰ, νέα μὲν ὄντα, μαλακά τ’ ἐστὶ καὶ ὑγρά· γηρῶντα δὲ, ἀεὶ καὶ μᾶλλον φαίνεται ξηραινόμενα· τελευτῶντα δὲ, τελέως ἀποξηραίνεται, καὶ τοῦτ’ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ὁ θάνατος. ὅτι μὲν οὖν ξηρόταταν ὡς ἐν ἡλικίαις τὸ γῆρας, ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων εὔδηλον· ὅτι δὲ καὶ ψυχρότατόν ἐστιν, ἔτ’ ἐναργέστερον, ὥστ’ οὐδ’ ἀμφισβητήσειεν οὐδεὶς ὑπέρ γε τούτου. καὶ γὰρ ἁπτομένοις οἱ γέροντες ψυχροὶ φαίνονται, καὶ ῥᾳδίως ἀποψύχονται, καὶ μελαίνονται, καὶ πελιδνοῦνται, καὶ τοῖς ψυχροῖς ἑτοίμως ἁλίσκονται νοσήμασιν, ἀποπληξίαις, παραλύσεσι, νάρκαις, τρόμοις, σπασμοῖς, κορύζαις, βρόγχοις. ἀπόλωλε δ’ αὐτῶν ὀλίγου δεῖν ἅπαν τὸ αἷμα, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο συναπόλωλε καὶ ἡ τῆς χρόας ἐρυθρότης. ἀλλὰ καὶ πέψις αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἀνάδοσις, ἐξαιμάτωσίς τε, καὶ πρόσθεσις, καὶ θρέψις, ὄρεξίς τε, καὶ αἴσθησις, καὶ κίνησις, ἀμυδρὰ πάντα καὶ κακῶς διακείμενα. καὶ τί γὰρ ἄλλο ἢ ὁδὸς ἐπὶ θάνατόν ἐστι τὸ γῆρας; ὥστ’, εἴπερ ὁ θάνατος σβέσις ἐστὶ τῆς ἐμφύτου θερμασίας, εἴη ἂν καὶ τὸ γῆρας οἷον μαρασμός τις αὐτῆς. οὐ μὴν περί γε τῆς τῶν παίδων ἡλικίας καὶ τῶν ἀκμαζόντων οὔθ’ ὁμολογεῖται τοῖς ἰατροῖς, οὔτε κρῖναι τὴν διαφωνίαν αὐτῶν εὐπετές. πιθανοὶ γὰρ ἑκατέρων οἱ λόγοι, τῶν τε τοὺς παῖδας ἀποφῃνάντων θερμοτέρους εἶναι τῶν ἀκμαζόντων, καὶ τῶν ἔμπαλιν τούτοις τοὺς ἀκμάζοντας τῶν παίδων. οἱ μὲν γὰρ, ὅτι θερμότατον ἁπάντων ἐστὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ ζώῳ κατὰ φύσιν ὑπαρχόντων ὁ τοῦ αἵματος χυμός· εἶθ’ ὅτι καὶ τὰ κυούμενα τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ὀλίγου δεῖν αἷμα μόνον ἐστὶν, ὕστερον δὲ, διαπλαττομένων ἤδη τῶν μορίων, τὸ μὲν ὀστοῦν γίνεται, τὸ δὲ ἀρτηρία, τὸ δὲ φλὲψ, τὸ δ’ ἄλλο τι, πάντα μὲν ἐρυθρὰ, καὶ πλεῖστον αἵματος εἰλικρινεστάτου τε καὶ θερμοτάτου μετέχοντα, συλλογίζονται θερμότατον εἶναι τὸ κυούμενον· εἰ δὲ τοῦτο, καὶ τοὺς παῖδας, ὅσῳπερ ἐγγυτέρω τοῖς κυουμένοις, θερμοτέρους εἶναι τῶν ἀκμαζόντων. οἱ δ’, ὅτι πολὺ μὲν κἀν τοῖς ἀκμάζουσι τὸ αἷμα, καὶ πλέον ἢ ἐν τοῖς παισὶν, ὥστε συνεχῶς διὰ τοῦθ’ αἱμοῤῥαγεῖν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὁ τῆς ξανθῆς χολῆς χυμὸς, αἵματος πολὺ θερμότερος ὑπάρχων, πλεῖστος αὐτοῖς ἐστι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο θερμοτέρους ἀποφαίνουσι τῶν παίδων τοὺς ἀκμάζοντας. αὖθις δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐνεργειῶν, οἱ μὲν, ὅτι καὶ αὐξάνονται, καὶ πλειόνων ἢ κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν τοῦ σώματος ὀρέγονταί τε καὶ κρατοῦσιν ἐδεσμάτων, ἰσχυρὰν ἐν τοῖς παισὶν εἶναί φασι τὴν θερμασίαν· οἱ δὲ τὸ μὲν αὐξάνεσθαι διὰ τὴν ὑγρότητα μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν τοῦ θερμοῦ ῥώμην ὑπάρχειν αὐτοῖς φασι, ταῖς μέντοι πέψεσιν οὐχ ὅπως πλεονεκτεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ πολὺ τῶν ἀκμαζόντων ἀπολείπεσθαι. ἐμέτους τε γὰρ ἀπέπτων αὐτοῖς γίνεσθαι τῶν σιτίων, καὶ διαχωρήσεις ὑγρῶν, καὶ τραχέων, καὶ ἀχυμώτων αὐτῶν. εἰ δ’ ὀρέγονται πλειόνων, οὐδὲν εἶναι τοῦτό φασι πρὸς τὴν ῥώμην τοῦ θερμοῦ. πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲ πλεονεξίᾳ θερμότητος ὀρέγεσθαι τὰ ζῶα, τοὐναντίον δ’ ἅπαν ἀποψυχομένων τῶν ὀρεκτικῶν μορίων· ἔπειτα δὲ, διότι μὴ μόνον εἰς θρέψιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ εἰς αὔξησιν αὐτοῖς ἡ τροφὴ διοικεῖται, διὰ τοῦτο πλειόνων ἐδεσμάτων προσδεῖσθαι. καὶ μέντοι ταῖς ἄλλαις ἐνεργείαις ἁπάσαις καὶ πάνυ σαφῶς ἀπολείπεσθαι τοὺς παῖδας τῶν ἀκμαζόντων. οὔτε γὰρ βαδίζειν, οὔτε θεῖν, οὔτε βαστάζειν, οὔθ’ ὅλως τι τῶν πρακτικῶν ἐνεργειῶν ὁμοίως ἐπιτελεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς αἰσθήσεις καὶ τὰς νοήσεις ἐν τοῖς ἀκμάζουσί φασιν εἰς ἄκρον ἥκειν ἀρετῆς· ὅλως δὲ τὸ μὲν ἀτελὲς ἔτι, τὸ δ’ ἤδη τέλειον εἶναι ζῶον. ἐν δὲ τοῖς τελείοις εὔλογον τὸ πρακτικώτατόν τε καὶ ἀρχικώτατον τῶν στοιχείων φασὶν ἐπικρατεῖν. ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ὕπνους πλείστους μὲν ἐν τοῖς παισὶν ἰδεῖν ἐστι γιγνομένους, ἐλαχίστους δὲ τοῖς ἀκμάζουσι. καίτοι τούτους γε, φασὶν, οὐδὲ μανεὶς ἄν τις ἑτέρως ἡγήσαιτο γίγνεσθαι, ἢ τοῦ θερμοῦ νικηθέντος πως καὶ βαρυνθέντος ὑπὸ πλήθους ὑγρότητος, ὡς ἔκ τε τῶν οἰνωθέντων ἐστὶν ἰδεῖν, ἔτι τε τῶν πλείω λουσαμένων. οὕτω δὲ καὶ μήκων ὑπνοποιός ἐστι, καὶ μανδραγόρας, καὶ θριδακίνη, καὶ πάνθ’ ὅσα τὴν κρᾶσιν ὑγρότερα καὶ ψυχρότερα. τοιαῦται μέν τινες αἱ ἑκατέρωθεν ἀμφισβητήσεις εἰσὶ περὶ τῶν προκειμένων ἡλικιῶν τῆς κράσεως. ἁπάσας γὰρ αὐτὰς ἐπεξέρχεσθαι περιττὸν εἶναί μοι δοκεῖ, τοῦ τύπου τῶν ἐπιχειρημάτων σαφῶς ἤδη κᾀξ ὧν εἰρήκαμεν ἐγνωσμένου. πόῤῥωθεν γὰρ ἑκάτεροι καὶ σχεδὸν ἀπὸ τῶν δευτέρων τὰ πρότερα συλλογίζονται, καὶ ὥσπερ εἰδότων ἤδη τῶν ἀκροατῶν, ὅπως μὲν αὔξησις, ὅπως δὲ πέψις, ὅπως δὲ θρέψις γίνεται, ποιοῦνται τὸν λόγον. ὡσαύτως δ’ ὑπὲρ αἰσθήσεως, καὶ κινήσεως, καὶ πρακτικῶν, καὶ φυσικῶν ἐνεργειῶν διέρχονται, καὶ γενέσεως ὕπνου μνημονεύουσι, καὶ σιτίων φύσεως, ὧν οὐδὲν ἁπλῶς ἐστι καὶ ῥᾳδίως γνώριμον, ἀλλὰ παμπόλλης μὲν ζητήσεως δεόμενον, ἴσως δ’ οὐδ’ εὑρεθῆναι δυνάμενον, εἰ μὴ πρότερόν τις εἰδείη γνωρίζειν ὑγρὰν καὶ ξηρὰν καὶ θερμὴν καὶ ψυχρὰν κρᾶσιν. ὅ τι γὰρ ἂν ἐκείνων ὡς γινώσκοντες ἤδη λέγωσιν, εἰ ἀναγκάσειέ τις αὐτοὺς ἀποδεικνύναι, πάντως δεήσονται τοῦ περὶ κράσεων λόγου τοῦ νῦν ἡμῖν ἐνεστῶτος. ὥστε δι’ ἀλλήλων τε καὶ ἐξ ἀλλήλων αὐτοῖς γίνεσθαι τὰς ἀποδείξεις, ἐκ μὲν τῶν νῦν ζητουμένων, ὡς ἤδη γινωσκομένων, ἐπειδὰν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐνεργειῶν διαλέγωνται, καὶ τὴν τῶν ἐδεσμάτων τε καὶ φαρμάκων ἐξευρίσκωσι δύναμιν, ὕπνου τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν τοιούτων ἐπισκέπτωνται. πάλιν δὲ αὖ τὰ νῦν ἐνεστῶτα δι’ ἐκείνων, ὡς ἤδη προεγνωσμένων, ἀποδεικνύουσιν. ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἐπαινῶ τὰς τοιαύτας ἀποδείξεις, ἀλλ’, εἰ χρὴ τἀληθὲς εἰπεῖν, οὐδ’ ἀποδείξεις εἶναι νομίζω, καθάπερ ἐπὶ πλέον δι’ ἑτέρων ἐδήλωσα. καὶ βέλτιον εἶναί φημι, κατὰ πᾶσαν διδασκαλίαν ὁρίσασθαι τὴν τάξιν τῶν νοημάτων. εἴπερ οὖν ἀρχὴ μέν ἐστι ἁπάσης τῆς περὶ κράσεων πραγματείας ἡ περὶ τῶν στοιχείων ἐπίσκεψις, εἴτε ἀπαθῆ καὶ ἀμετάβλητα τελέως ἐστὶν, εἴτ’ ἀλλοιοῦσθαί τε καὶ μεταβάλλεσθαι δυνάμενα, μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐκείνων ἐπιστήμην ἐφεξῆς ἐστι δεύτερος ὁ νῦν ἡμῖν ἐνεστηκὼς λόγος, οὐ χρὴ λαμβάνειν αὐτῶν τὰς πίστεις ἐκ τῶν μήπω γινωσκομένων, ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ ὀρθόν τέ ἐστι καὶ δίκαιον, ἤ τι τῶν ἐναργῶν εἶναι προσήκει τὸ ληφθησόμενον εἰς τὴν ἀπόδειξιν, ἤ τι τῶν προαποδεδειγμένων. οὔτ’ οὖν ὕπνου γενέσεως μνημονευτέον, οὔτε πέψεως, οὔτ’ αὐξήσεως, οὐδ’ ἄλλου τῶν τοιούτων μηδενὸς, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ μόνης καὶ ψιλῆς τῆς οὐσίας τῶν ὑποκειμένων πραγμάτων ἡ ζήτησις γιγνέσθω, καθάπερ καὶ διὰ τοῦ πρώτου λόγου πεποιήμεθα. διελόμενοι γὰρ, ὡς ἕτερον μέν ἐστι τὸ κατ’ ἐνέργειαν, ἕτερον δὲ τὸ κατὰ δύναμιν, ὑπὲρ τοῦ κατ’ ἐνέργειαν ὄντος ἤδη θερμοῦ, καὶ ψυχροῦ, καὶ ξηροῦ, καὶ ὑγροῦ τὸν λόγον ἔφαμεν χρῆναι ποιήσασθαι πρότερον· ἔπειτα οὕτως ἐπὶ τὰ κατὰ δύναμιν ἀφικέσθαι. πρόχειρος δ’ ἐστὶ πᾶσι καὶ γνώριμος ἡ τῶν κατ’ ἐνέργειαν ἤδη θερμῶν, καὶ ψυχρῶν, ὑγρῶν τε καὶ ξηρῶν διάγνωσις. ἁφὴ γὰρ τά γε τοιαῦτα διακρίνειν πέφυκεν, ἡ καὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτὸ θερμὸν εἶναι διδάξασα, καὶ τὸν κρύσταλλον ψυχρόν. εἰ δ’ ἄλλοθέν ποθεν ἔχουσιν ἔννοιάν τε καὶ διάγνωσιν θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ, λεγέτωσαν ἡμῖν· ἀμήχανυν γάρ τινα σοφίαν ἐπαγγέλλονται, μᾶλλον δ’, εἰ χρὴ τἀληθὲς εἰπεῖν, ἐμπληξίαν, εἰ πραγμάτων αἰσθητῶν ἕτερόν τι πρεσβύτερον αἰσθήσεως ἔχουσι κριτήριον. καὶ μὴν, εἰ μηδὲν ἄλλο τῶν ἐνεργείᾳ θερμῶν ἐγχωρεῖ κριτήριον ὑπάρχειν, ἁπτέσθωσαν ἤδη πολλῶν ἐφεξῆς ἀνδρῶν, καὶ γερόντων, καὶ μειρακίων, καὶ παίδων, καὶ βρεφῶν· οὕτω γὰρ ἐξευρήσουσι τοὺς μᾶλλόν τε καὶ ἧττον θερμούς. εἰ δ’ αἰσθητῶν πραγμάτων λογικὰς ἀποδείξεις ζητοῦσιν, ὥρα τι καὶ περὶ τῆς χιόνος αὐτῆς ἤδη σκοπεῖν, εἴτε λευκὴν, ὡς ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις φαίνεται, νομιστέον αὐτὴν, εἴτε καὶ μὴ λευκὴν, ὡς Ἀναξαγόρας ἀπεφῄνατο· καὶ μέντοι καὶ περὶ πίττης ὡσαύτως ἀνασκοπεῖν τε καὶ κόρακος, ἁπάντων τε τῶν ἄλλων. οὐ γὰρ δὴ τὸ μὲν λευκὸν ἀπιστεῖσθαι χρὴ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὁρῶντας, ἄνευ δ’ ἀποδείξεως ἐπὶ τῶν μελάνων πιστεύεσθαι. ἅπαντα οὖν ἤδη τὰ τῶν αἰσθήσεων ἄπιστα φάμενοι, μήτε τὸν κύκνον λευκὸν εἶναι λεγόντων, ἐὰν μὴ πρότερον ἐπισκέψωνται λόγῳ, μήτε τὸν τίτανον, ἢ τὴν ἡμέραν, ἢ αὐτὸν τὸν ἥλιον. οὕτω δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν φωνῶν ἀπιστησάτωσαν ἀκοῇ, καὶ περὶ τῶν ὀσμῶν ταῖς ῥισὶ, καὶ περὶ πάντων τῶν ἁπτῶν ἁφῇ. εἶτα ταῦτα οὐ Πυῤῥώνειος ἀπορία καὶ λῆρος ἀπέραντος; οὐ μὴν καὶ δίκαιόν γε ἦν τοὺς τὴν ἀρίστην αἵρεσιν ἑλομένους τῶν ἐν φιλοσοφίᾳ, τὴν τὸ θερμὸν καὶ τὸ ψυχρὸν καὶ τὸ ξηρὸν καὶ τὸ ὑγρὸν ἀρχὰς καὶ στοιχεῖα τιθεμένην, εἰς τοσοῦτο ἀποπλανηθῆναι ἀπὸ τῶν ταῦτα θεμένων ἀνδρῶν, ὡς μὴ γινώσκειν, ὅτι τε πάσης ἀποδείξεως ἀρχαὶ τὰ πρὸς αἴσθησίν τε καὶ νόησίν ἐστιν ἐναργῆ, καὶ ὅστις περὶ τούτων ἀπορεῖ, μάτην ὑπὲρ τῶν ἄλλων ζητεῖ, μηδ’, ὁπόθεν ἄρξηται, καταλελοιπὼς ἑαυτῷ. πόθεν οὖν εἰς μακρὰν οὕτως ἄλην ἐτράποντο, καὶ λόγῳ ζητεῖν ἐπεχείρησαν αἰσθητῶν πραγμάτων διάγνωσιν, ἐγὼ μὲν οὐδ’ ἐπινοῆσαι δύναμαι. καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἁφῇ μὲν κρίνω τὸ κατ’ ἐνέργειαν θερμόν· εἴ τι δ’ οὔπω μέν ἐστι θερμὸν, ἐπιτήδειον δὲ γενέσθαι τοιοῦτο, ὃ δὴ καὶ δυνάμει θερμὸν ὀνομάζεται, τοῦτ’ ἐξευρίσκειν λόγῳ πειρῶμαι. τοῖς δ’ οὐκ οἷδ’ ὅπως ἀνατέτραπται πάντα, καὶ ῥητορεία μακρὰ περὶ τῶν ἐπιχειρημάτων ἤσκηται. τούτους μὲν οὖν ἐάσωμεν, ἀναμνήσαντες ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς τό γε τοσοῦτο καὶ νῦν, ὡς ἀρχὴ δογμάτων μοχθηρῶν ἐστι μία τὸ μηδὲν ὑπὲρ ἀποδείξεως ἐσκέφθαι πρότερον, ἀλλ’ ἅμα τὰ πράγματα ζητεῖν, καὶ ὡς εἰδότας, ὅ τί ποτέ ἐστιν ἀπόδειξις, ἐπιχειρεῖν ἀποδεικνύειν. ἐπανελθόντες οὖν αὖθις ἐπὶ τὸ προκείμενον, ἁφῇ κρίνωμεν πρώτως καὶ μάλιστα τὸ κατὰ τὰς ἡλικίας θερμόν. ἔσται δ’ ἡμῶν ἡ κρίσις ἀρίστη καθ’ ἓν καὶ ταὐτὸ σῶμα βρέφους ἑνός. οὐ γὰρ ἀδύνατον, ὁποία τέ τις ἡ θερμασία διετεῖ τὴν ἡλικίαν ὑπάρχοντι προϋπῆρχεν αὐτῷ, μεμνῆσθαι, καὶ ὁποία νῦν ἐστι, δυοῖν ἢ τριῶν ἐτῶν, εἰ τύχοι, μεταξὺ γενομένων. εἰ γὰρ ὅλως φαίνοιτο μεταβολή τις ἐπὶ θερμὸν ἢ ψυχρὸν γεγονέναι τῷ βρέφει, χαλεπὸν οὐδὲν ἔτι συλλογίζεσθαι τὴν ἕως τῆς ἀκμῆς ἐσομένην ὑπεροχήν. εἰ δὲ καὶ πλείω παιδία πολλοῖς ἀκμάζουσιν ἐθέλοις παραβάλλειν, ἰσχνὰ μὲν ἰσχνοῖς, εὔσαρκα δ’ εὐσάρκοις, καὶ παχέα παχέσι παράβαλλε· οὕτω δὲ καὶ χρόας ὡσαύτως ἔχοντα, καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων ὡς οἷόν τε. τὴν γὰρ ἐν ταῖς ἡλικίαις διαφορὰν ἐξευρεῖν ζητῶν, ἐπὶ τῶν ὁμοίων ὡς ἔνι μάλιστα φύσεων ἀσφαλέστερον ἂν ἐπισκέπτοιο. τὸ δ’ ἐπὶ τῶν ἐναντίων ἐξετάζειν οὐ σμικρὸν ἔχει τὸν παραλογισμὸν, οὐ διὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν ἐνίοτε τῆς τῶν δοκιμαζομένων σωμάτων διαφορᾶς, ἀλλὰ διὰ φυσικὴν ὑπαρχούσης κρᾶσιν. ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ διαίτῃ πάσῃ, καὶ τοῖς καιροῖς, ἐν οἷς ἐξετάζεται, παραπλησίως ἔχοντα προαιρεῖσθαι τὰ σώματα, μὴ γεγυμνασμένον ἠργηκότι παραβάλλοντας, ἢ λελουμένον ἀλούτῳ, μηδ’ ἄσιτον ἐδηδοκότι, καὶ διψῶντα μεμεθυσμένῳ, μηδὲ τὸν ἐν ἡλίῳ θαλφθέντα τῷ ῥιγώσαντι διὰ κρύος, ἢ τὸν ἀγρυπνήσαντα τῷ κεκοιμημένῳ, μήθ’ ὅλως τοῖς ἐξ ἐναντίας φύσεως ἢ διαίτης ἢ περιστάσεως πραγμάτων ἡστινοσοῦν, ἀλλ’ ὡς οἷόν τε πάνθ’ ὡσαύτως ὑπαρχέτω τἄλλα, πλὴν τῆς ἡλικίας αὐτῆς. οὕτω δὲ δηλονότι καὶ αὐτὸν τὸν ἕνα παῖδα παραβάλλων ἑαυτῷ, τὰς ἔξωθεν ἁπάσας αὐτοῦ περιστάσεις ἀκριβῶς ὁμοίας φυλάξεις, ἵνα μὴ τὸ διά τινα τούτων ἐν θάλψει τε καὶ ψύξει διαφέρον εἰς τὴν τῆς ἡλικίας ἀναφέρηται μεταβολήν. μακρὰν ἴσως σοι δόξω λέγειν τὴν ἐξέτασιν, ἀλλ’ ἀληθῆ γε παντὸς μᾶλλον, ἐξ αὐτῆς τε τοῦ ζητουμένου τῆς οὐσίας λαμβανομένην, ὡς ἐν τοῖς ὑπὲρ ἀποδείξεως ἐλέγομεν. σὺ δὲ ἴσως αἱρήσῃ τὴν ἐπίτομον, οὐδὲν φροντίζων, εἰ ψευδὴς εἴη. ἴσθι τοίνυν οὐ μόνον ψευδῆ βαδίσων, ἀλλὰ καὶ μακράν. οὐ γὰρ ἔτεσι τρισὶν ἢ τέτταρσιν ἐξευρήσεις τὸ ζητούμενον, ἀλλ’ ἐν παντὶ τῷ βίῳ φυλάξεις τὴν ἄγνοιαν. ὅσον γὰρ ἐπὶ ταῖς ἀντιλογίαις τῶν ἀνδρῶν, οὐδὲν ἀποδειχθῆναι δύναται σαφῶς· οὐδ’ εὔλογον ὅλως ἐκ τῶν ὑστέρων πιστοῦσθαι τὰ πρότερα. κρίνωμεν οὖν αἰσθήσει τὸ θερμὸν καὶ ψυχρὸν σῶμα, τό γε κατ’ ἐνέργειαν ἤδη τοιοῦτο, καὶ μηκέτι δυνάμει, παρέντες τήν τε κρίσιν πρώτην, τά τ’ ἄλλα σύμπαντα γνωρίσματα. καὶ δὴ σὲ μὲν ὡς εὖ κρινοῦντα πρὸς τὴν πεῖραν ἀπολύω, τὴν δ’ ἐμὴν αὐτὸς κρίσιν ἑρμηνεύσω. πολλῶν γὰρ ἐφεξῆς ἁπτόμενος σωμάτων ἐπιμελῶς, οὐ παίδων μόνων, ἢ βρεφῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ μειρακίων καὶ ἀκμαζόντων, εὕρισκον οὐδετέρους ἀληθεύοντας, οὔτε τοὺς θερμότερον ἁπλῶς, οὔτε τοὺς ψυχρότερον εἰπόντας εἶναι τὸν ἀκμάζοντα τοῦ παιδός. εἰ γὰρ τὰς ἄλλας ἁπάσας τὰς ἔξωθεν ἀφελὼν ἀλλοιώσεις, τὰς ἐκ τῆς ἡλικίας μόνης ἐπισκέπτοιο διαφορὰς, οὐδέτερός σοι φαίνεται θερμότερος ἁπλῶς. ποιότητι γάρ τοι διαφέρουσιν αὐτῶν αἱ θερμότητες ἐπ’ ἀνίσῳ τῇ διαπνοῇ, δι’ ἣν καὶ σοφιζόμενοί τινες, ἢ τοὺς πέλας, ἢ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς, οἱ μὲν τὴν τοῦ παιδὸς, οἱ δὲ τὴν τοῦ νεανίσκου θερμασίαν ἰσχυροτέραν εἶναι νομίζουσιν. ἔστι γὰρ ἡ μὲν τῶν παίδων ἀτμωδεστέρα τε καὶ πολλὴ, καὶ ἡδίων τοῖς ἁπτομένοις, ἡ δὲ τῶν ἀκμαζόντων ὑπόδριμύ τι καὶ οὐχ ἡδὺ κέκτηται. τοῦτ’ οὖν τὸ διάφορον τῆς προσβολῆς ἀναπείθει τοὺς πλείους ἀποφαίνεσθαι, θερμότερον εἶναι τῶν ἀκμαζόντων τὸ σῶμα. τὸ δ’ οὐχ οὕτως ἔχει. τῷ γὰρ ἀσκήσαντι τὴν ἁφὴν ἐν διαφόροις ὕλαις διαγνωστικὴν εἶναι θερμότητος ἰσχυροτέρας τε καὶ ἀσθενεστέρας καὶ ἴσης, εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι καὶ ἡ τῶν παίδων αὐτῷ ἤτοι γ’ ἴση φανεῖται τὴν ἰσχὺν τῇ τῶν ἀκμαζόντων, ἢ πλείων. ἡ δ’ ἄσκησις ἥδε· χρὴ γὰρ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐναργεστάτων ἄρξασθαι. τῶν βαλανείων ἐνίοτε θερμὸς οὕτως ἐστὶν ὁ ἀὴρ, ὡς μηδένα φέρειν αὐτὸν, ἀλλὰ καίεσθαι δοκεῖν, ἐνίοτε δ’ οὕτω ψυχρὸς, ὡς ἱδροῦν μὴ δύνασθαι. καὶ μὴν καὶ ὅτι τρίτη τις ἄλλη παρὰ τάσδε κατάστασίς ἐστιν, ἧς μάλιστα χρῄζομεν, ἡ εὔκρατος, οὐδὲν δέομαι λέγειν. αἱ δ’ αὐταὶ τρεῖς καταστάσεις ἐν τῷ τῆς κολυμβήθρας ὕδατι φαίνονται. καὶ γὰρ θερμὸν οὕτως, ὡς καίεσθαι πρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ψυχρὸν, ὡς μηδὲ θερμαίνεσθαι, καὶ εὔκρατον, ὡς συμμέτρως θερμαίνεσθαι, πολλάκις εὑρίσκεται. εἰ τοίνυν ἐροίμην σε, πότερόν ἐστι θερμότερον; ἆρά γε τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ εὔκρατον, ἢ ὁ ἀὴρ ὁ εὔκρατος; οὐκ ἂν ἔχοις εἰπεῖν οὐδέτερον. ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντων ὁμοίως ἡδέων τε καὶ συμμέτρων τῷ σώματι, τὸ μὲν θερμότερον λέγειν αὐτῶν, τὸ δὲ ψυχρότερον, οὐδένα νοῦν ἔχειν ἡγοῦμαι. καὶ μὴν εἰ νοήσαις τὸ τῆς δεξαμενῆς ὕδωρ εἰς ἄκρον θερμότητος ἀφικνούμενον, ὡς ζεῖν, ἢ τὸν ἀέρα τελέως ἐκφλογούμενον, ὅτι πρὸς ἀμφοῖν ὡσαύτως καυθήσῃ, πρόδηλον. εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ νοήσαις αὖθις ἢ τὸ ὕδωρ οὕτω ψυχρὸν, ὡς ἐγγὺς ἤδη πήξεως εἶναι, ἢ τὸν ἀέρα τελέως ἐψυγμένον, ὡς ἐν τοῖς νιφετοῖς γίγνεται, δῆλον ὡς καὶ πρὸς τούτων ἑκατέρων ὁμοίως ψυγήσῃ τε καὶ ῥιγώσεις. οὐκοῦν καὶ θερμότητα καὶ ψύξιν ἄκραν ὡσαύτως ἀέρι νοήσεις ἐγγινομένην, ὡσαύτως καὶ ὕδατι, καὶ τῶν ἄκρων ἑκατέρων τὸ μέσον ὁμοίως ἀμφοῖν ἐγγινόμενον· ὥστε καὶ τὸ μεταξὺ πάντων τῶν ἄκρων τε καὶ τοῦ μέσου κατά τε τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ τὸν ἀέρα τὰς αὐτὰς ὑπεροχάς τε καὶ διαστάσεις ἕξει. καὶ τοσούτῳ ποτὲ φήσεις εἶναι τοῦ μετρίου θερμότερον θάτερον, ὅσῳ θάτερον. οὕτω δὲ καὶ ψυχρότερον τοῦ μετρίου τοσούτῳ φήσεις εἶναί ποτε τὸ ὕδωρ, ὅσῳ καὶ τὸν ἀέρα. καίτοι τό γε τῆς προσβολῆς ἴδιον οὐ ταὐτὸ ἑκατέροις ἦν. οὐ γὰρ ὡσαύτως ὕδωρ εὔκρατον, ὡς ἀὴρ εὔκρατος, προσπίπτει. καὶ τί δεῖ λέγειν ἐπὶ τῶν οὕτως ἀνομοίων; αὐτοῦ γὰρ τοῦ ἀέρος ὁμοίως ὄντος θερμοῦ διαφέρουσαι γίγνονται προσβολαὶ παρὰ τὸ ποτὲ μὲν οἷον ἀχλυώδη τε καὶ ἀτμώδη, ποτὲ δὲ οἷον λιγνυώδη τε καὶ καπνώδη, ποτὲ δὲ καθαρὸν ἀκριβῶς ὑπάρχειν. ἐν πολλαῖς οὖν καὶ διαφερούσαις ἰσότης γίνεται θερμότητος, ἐξαπατῶσα τοὺς ἀσκέπτους ὡς ἄνισος, ὅτι γε κατὰ πᾶν ὁμοία φαίνεται. λελογισμένου μήν ἐστιν ἀνδρὸς τοὺς λογισμοὺς, οὓς εἴρηκα, καὶ γεγυμνασμένου τὴν αἴσθησιν ἐν πολλῇ τῇ κατὰ μέρος ἐμπειρίᾳ, τὴν ἰσότητα τῆς θερμότητος ἐξευρεῖν ἔν τε τοῖς παισὶ καὶ τοῖς ἀκμάζουσι, καὶ μὴ τῷ τὴν μὲν ἐφ’ ὑγρᾶς οὐσίας φαίνεσθαι, τὴν δ’ ἐπὶ ξηρᾶς, ἐξαπατᾶσθαι. καὶ γὰρ λίθος ὕδατι δύναταί ποτε τὴν ἴσην δέξασθαι θερμασίαν, οὐδὲν διαφέρον, εἰ ξηρὸς μὲν ὁ λίθος ἐστὶν, ὑγρὸν δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ. οὕτως οὖν ἔμοιγε μυριάκις ἐπισκεψαμένῳ καὶ παῖδας καὶ νεανίσκους πολλοὺς, καὶ μειράκια, καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν παῖδα καὶ βρέφος καὶ μειράκιον γενόμενον, οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ἐφάνη θερμότερος οὔτε παιδὸς ἀκμάζων, οὔτ’ ἀκμάζοντος παῖς. ἀλλ’, ὡς εἴρηται, μόνον ἐν μὲν τοῖς παισὶν ἀτμωδεστέρα τε καὶ πολλὴ καὶ ἡδεῖα, ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἀκμάζουσιν ὀλίγη καὶ ξηρὰ καὶ οὐχ ὁμοίως ἡδεῖα τῆς θερμασίας ἡ προσβολή. πολὺ μὲν γὰρ τῆς τῶν παίδων οὐσίας, ὑγρᾶς οὔσης, ἐκτὸς ἀποῤῥεῖ, βραχὺ δὲ τῆς τῶν ἀκμαζόντων, ξηρᾶς ὑπαρχούσης. οὐδέτερος οὖν αὐτῶν ἁπλῶς φαίνεται θερμότερος, ἀλλ’ ὁ μὲν τῷ πλήθει τῆς διαπνοῆς, ὁ δὲ τῇ δριμύτητι. τὸ γὰρ ἔμφυτον θερμὸν ὁ παῖς ἔχει πλέον, εἴ γ’ ἐξ αἵματος καὶ σπέρματος ἡ γένεσις αὐτῷ, καὶ ἥδιον· ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἀκμάζουσιν ὀλίγη καὶ ξηρὰ καὶ οὐχ ὁμοίως ἡδεῖα τῆς θερμασίας ἡ προσβολή.",
      "openai_translation": "Let us then consider the living creature just now being formed in the wombs of those that are pregnant, in order to understand how it is at once most moist and most hot. For its first constitution is from blood and seed, which are moist and hot substances. And as these are continually and increasingly made drier, first membranes are fashioned, and tunics, and viscera, and vessels; lastly bones, and nails, and cartilages are completed as the substance congeals. For before the underlying substance is either able to be stretched or to be congealed, none of the aforementioned things can come to be. Thus membranes and tunics and arteries and sinews and veins are produced when the substance is being stretched; but bones and cartilages and nails and hooves and viscera are produced when it congeals. And when these have been completed in this way, in due course the creature is born during gestation. Yet it is still ultimately moist, like moss, not only in its vessels and viscera and flesh, but even in the bones themselves, which in us are in fact the driest of our parts. Nevertheless the nurses of infants mold even these and all the limbs along with them, as if they were waxen. So great is the moistness in the whole body of children. And if you wanted either to eat a young sacrificial animal or to examine it by cutting it open, you would find the flesh mucous and flabby, while the entire bony kind is like cheese only just set, so that the bodies of newborn animals are not pleasant to eat because of their excessive moistness. And pigs and sheep have especially this condition, because they are by far the moister; goats, on the other hand, because they are drier, are better and sweeter to eat. Conversely, in comparison with young sacrificial animals, those that are aged are sufficiently dry, and without sap, and insipid—both the bones in their entirety and all their ligaments—and their flesh, arteries, veins, and sinews are sinewy and hard on account of age, unpleasant and insipid like thongs. Those that are intermediate between these and the newborns—so far as they have already advanced in ages, so far they have also advanced toward extreme dryness away from old age; and as for the younger, still growing, so far have they departed from the moistness of embryos as they have progressed in years. The prime is set, more than all the ages of living creatures, in the middle between the extremes, having neither arrived at the ultimate dryness, like old age, nor established in much moistness and flabbiness, like the age of infants.\n\nWhy, then, did some of the esteemed physicians declare that old age is moist? Or were they evidently deceived by the abundance of superfluities [perittōmata: excretions/accumulations]? For their eyes water, and their noses fill with coryza, and in the mouth a multitude of saliva gathers; and they cough and bring up phlegm, showing thereby that the lung too is full of such a humor; and their stomach is filled with phlegm, and each of the joints is mucous. But none of these things contradicts the claim that the bodies of the aged are dry. For you will find the sinews, the arteries, the veins, the membranes, and the tunics of all the organs much drier than before, while, wrapped around them within and without, there is either some phlegmatic humor or mucous moisture. So far are all such signs from proving old age to be moist that they seem to me to testify to its dryness. For it is precisely for this reason that each of the parts becomes drier: that the hot element, being diseased, no longer nourishes them as before. A mass of moist superfluities floods them from without, while the depth of the body itself is dry—being able neither to draw the nourishment inward nor to enjoy it sufficiently. Therefore the old man is moist not in his own proper parts, but in his superfluities; and he is dry not in his superfluities, but in the parts themselves—so that in one respect he is dry, in another moist. But the present discussion is not about the superfluities themselves, but about the proper parts, whose activities in accordance with nature complete life. In these, then, the old man is dry, whereas the child was moist—in the very solid parts of the body: bones, membranes, ligaments, arteries, veins, sinews, tunics, and flesh. And Aristotle rightly likens old age to a plant that is withering. For plants too, when young, are soft and moist; but as they grow old, they are always and increasingly seen to dry out; and when they perish, they are completely desiccated—and this is their death. That old age is the driest among the ages is clear from what has been said; and that it is also the coldest is even more evident, so that no one would dispute this. For the old appear cold to the touch; they are easily chilled; they turn dark and sallow; and they readily fall prey to cold diseases—apoplexies, paralyses, numbness, tremors, convulsions, coryza, bronchial affections. Practically all their blood has perished; and therefore the redness of the skin has perished along with it. Moreover digestion, distribution [anadosis], depletion of blood [exaimatosis], addition [prosthesis], nutrition, appetite, sensation, and movement—all are faint and in poor condition. For what else is old age but a road toward death? So, if death is the extinction of innate heat, old age would be a kind of wasting of it.\n\nHowever, concerning the ages of children and of those in their prime, neither do the physicians agree, nor is it easy to judge their disagreement. For the arguments of both sides are plausible—of those who declare children to be hotter than those in their prime, and of those who, conversely, declare those in their prime to be hotter than children. The former argue that the juice of the blood is the hottest of all the things naturally present in a living creature; and then that what is carried in the womb is at first almost nothing but blood, but later, when the parts are already being shaped, one becomes bone, another artery, another vein, another something else—all red and partaking of the most pure and hottest blood in greatest measure—and they infer that what is in the womb is the hottest; and if that is so, then children, being nearer to those",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 2.2:**\n\nLet us then consider the animal as it is being formed in the wombs of those giving birth, so that we may understand how it is extremely moist and extremely hot. For its first constitution comes from blood and seed, moist and hot substances. And as these continually become drier, membranes are first formed, and tunics, and organs, and vessels, and finally bones, nails, and cartilages are completed as the substance solidifies; for before the underlying substance is able either to be stretched or to solidify, none of the aforementioned things can come to be. Tunics and membranes, arteries, sinews, and veins are completed when it is stretched, while bones, cartilages, nails, hooves, and organs are completed when it solidifies. When these have been thus perfected, birth follows in due course during pregnancy. It is still extremely moist like moss, not only in vessels, organs, and flesh, but even in the bones themselves, which are indeed the driest of the parts in us. But nevertheless, nurses mold both these and entire limbs of infants along with them, as if they were waxen. Such is the moisture in the entire body of children. But also if you wish either to eat or to examine by dissection a young sacrificial animal, you will find the flesh mucous and flabby, and the entire bony genus resembling freshly curdled cheese, so that the bodies of newborn animals are not even pleasant to eat due to excessive moisture. This is especially true of pigs and sheep, because they are particularly moist. Goats, because they are drier, are better and more pleasant to eat. Conversely to young sacrificial animals, those that have aged are considerably dry, sapless, and juiceless, having all their bones and all their ligaments, sinewy and hard flesh, and their arteries, veins, and sinews, due to age, unpleasant and juiceless like leather straps. Those in between these and the newly born - those that have already advanced in age - fall as far short of extreme dryness as they do of old age; while those that are younger and still growing have departed from the moisture of embryos to the same degree that they have advanced in age. The prime of life of all animals stands most in the middle of the extremes, neither reaching extreme dryness like old age, nor existing in great moisture and flabbiness like the age of infants.\n\nWhy then have some distinguished physicians declared old age to be moist? Obviously because they were deceived by the abundance of excretions? For their eyes weep, their noses fill with mucus, an abundance of saliva collects in the mouth, and they also cough and spit up phlegm, showing that the lung too is full of such humor; and their stomach is filled with phlegm, and each of their joints is somewhat mucous. But none of these things contradicts the fact that the bodies of the aged are dry. For you will find the sinews, arteries, veins, membranes, and tunics of all the organs much drier than before, but with either phlegmatic humor or mucous moisture plastered around them inside and out. But so far are all such signs from declaring old age moist that they seem to me to testify to its dryness. For each of the parts becomes drier for this very reason: that it is no longer similarly nourished now due to weakness of the heat. For while an abundance of moist excretions floods it from outside, the very depth of each body is dry, being unable either to draw nourishment inward or to benefit sufficiently from it. Therefore the old person is moist, not in his proper parts, but in excretions, and dry, not in excretions, but in the parts themselves, so that he is dry in one respect, moist in another. But our discussion now is not about the excretions themselves, but about the proper parts, whose natural functions complete life. In these, then, the old person is dry where the child was moist - in the very solid parts of the body: bones, membranes, ligaments, arteries, veins, sinews, tunics, and flesh. And Aristotle rightly likens old age to a withering plant. For plants too, when young, are soft and moist; but as they age, they appear to become continually drier; and when dying, they completely dry out, and this is their death.\n\nThat old age is the driest of the ages is clear from what has been said; that it is also the coldest is even more evident, so that no one would dispute this point. For old people appear cold to the touch, they easily become chilled, turn black and livid, and readily fall victim to cold diseases: apoplexy, paralysis, numbness, tremors, spasms, catarrh, bronchitis. Almost all their blood has perished, and therefore the redness of their complexion has perished with it. But also their digestion, distribution, blood-formation, assimilation, nutrition, appetite, sensation, and movement are all faint and in poor condition. And what else is old age but a road to death? So if death is the extinction of innate heat, old age would be like a wasting away of it.\n\nHowever, regarding the age of children and those in their prime, physicians neither agree nor is it easy to judge their disagreement. For the arguments of both sides are plausible - both those who declare children to be hotter than those in their prime, and those who say the opposite, that those in their prime are hotter than children. Some argue that the humor of blood is the hottest of all things naturally present in the animal; then that embryos are at first almost nothing but blood, and later, when the parts are being formed, one becomes bone, another artery, another vein, another something else, all red and partaking of the most pure and hottest blood, and conclude that the embryo is hottest; and if this is so, then children, being closer to embryos, are hotter than those in their prime. Others argue that there is much blood in those in their prime, more than in children, so that they continually have nosebleeds because of this, and also that the humor of yellow bile, being much hotter than blood, is most abundant in them, and therefore declare those in their prime hotter than children.\n\nAgain, from functions, some say that because children grow and desire and master more food than proportionate to their body size, the heat in children is strong; others say that growth occurs more due to moisture than the strength of heat, and that in digestion they not only do not excel but fall far short of those in their prime. For they vomit undigested food, and have bowel movements of moist, rough, and unjuiced matter. If they desire more food, they say this is nothing regarding the strength of heat. First, animals do not desire food due to excess heat, but quite the opposite when the appetitive parts are cooled; second, because food is distributed not only for nutrition but also for growth, they therefore need more food. And indeed in all other functions children very clearly fall short of those in their prime. They neither walk, run, carry, nor perform any practical functions similarly, but they say that sensations and thoughts reach the peak of excellence in those in their prime; and in general, one is still an incomplete animal, the other already complete. And they say it is reasonable that in complete animals the most active and ruling of the elements prevails. But also we can see that sleep occurs most in children, least in those in their prime. Yet no one, even if mad, they say, would think these occur otherwise than when heat is somehow overcome and weighed down by an abundance of moisture, as can be seen from those who are drunk and those who have bathed excessively. Thus poppy is sleep-inducing, as are mandrake and lettuce, and all things that are moister and colder in temperament.\n\nSuch are the disputes from both sides about the temperament of the ages in question. For it seems to me superfluous to go through all of them, since the pattern of arguments is already clearly known from what we have said. For both sides syllogize from afar and almost from secondary things to primary ones, and make their argument as if their listeners already know how growth occurs, how digestion, how nutrition. Similarly they discuss sensation, movement, practical and natural functions, mention the generation of sleep and the nature of foods, none of which is simple and easily knowable, but requires extensive investigation and perhaps cannot even be discovered unless one first knows how to recognize moist, dry, hot, and cold temperament. For whatever they say about those things as if already knowing them, if one were to force them to demonstrate, they would certainly need the discussion about temperaments that we now have before us. So that their demonstrations come from and through each other - from things now being investigated, as if already known, when they discuss functions and discover the power of foods and drugs, and examine sleep an",

      "gemini_translation": "Here is the translation of the provided Ancient Greek paragraph.\n\n**Paragraph 2.2:**\n\nLet us conceive, then, of the living being just now being formed in the wombs of those giving birth, so that we may know how it is most moist and most hot. For its first constitution is from blood and seed, which are moist and hot substances. And as these things progressively become drier, membranes are formed first, and tunics [coverings], and viscera, and vessels, and finally bones, nails, and cartilages are completed as the substance congeals; for before the underlying substance is able either to be stretched or to congeal, it is not possible for any of the aforementioned things to come into being. Tunics, then, and membranes, arteries, nerves, and veins are completed as it [the substance] is stretched, while bones, cartilages, nails, hooves, and viscera are completed as it congeals. When these things have been thus perfected, it is born next in the course of gestation. And it is still extremely moist, like a budding plant, not only in its vessels, viscera, and flesh, but also in its very bones, which are indeed the driest of the parts within us. But nevertheless, nurses shape even these and, along with them, the limbs as a whole, as if they were made of wax. Such is the great moisture in the entire body of children.\n\nAnd indeed, if you should wish to eat a young sacrificial animal or to dissect and examine one, you will find the flesh slimy and flabby, and the entire bony substance resembles freshly congealed cheese, so that the bodies of newborn animals are not even pleasant to eat on account of their excessive moisture. This is especially the case with pigs and sheep, because they are also especially moist. The meat of goats, because they are drier, is better and more pleasant to eat. In contrast to young animals, the aged are sufficiently dry, juiceless, and without flavor; they have all their bones and all their ligaments completely so, while their flesh, arteries, veins, and nerves are sinewy and hard on account of their age, unpleasant and flavorless like leather straps. As for those in the state between these and the newly born: those who have already advanced in age fall short of extreme dryness by as much as they fall short of old age; and those who are younger and still growing have departed from the moisture of embryos by as much as they have advanced in age. The prime of life [akmē], most of all in living beings, is established in the middle of the extremes, neither having reached the extreme of dryness, like old age, nor being established in great moisture and flabbiness, like the age of infants.\n\nWhy then have some reputable physicians declared old age to be moist? Is it not clear that they were deceived by the multitude of superfluities [perittōmata]? For their eyes tear, their nostrils fill with catarrh, a great amount of saliva gathers in the mouth, and they also cough and spit up phlegm, revealing that the lung, too, is full of such a humor; and their stomach is filled with phlegm, and each of their joints is slimy. But none of these things contradicts the fact that the bodies of the old are dry. For you will find the nerves, arteries, veins, membranes, and the tunics of all the organs to be much drier than before, but coated inside and out with either some phlegmatic humor or a slimy moisture. But far from being signs that prove old age is moist, they seem to me to bear witness to its dryness. For it is for this very reason that each of the parts becomes drier: because it is no longer nourished in the same way, now that the innate heat is weak. For a multitude of moist superfluities inundates it from without, but the very depth of each body is dry, being able neither to draw nourishment inward nor to make sufficient use of it. The old person is moist, therefore, not in his proper parts, but in his superfluities; and he is dry, not in his superfluities, but in the parts themselves, so that he is dry in one respect and moist in another. But our discussion now is not about the superfluities themselves, but about the proper parts, whose natural functions constitute life. In these, therefore, the old person is dry, in which the child was moist—in the solid parts of the body themselves: bones and membranes, ligaments, arteries, veins, nerves, tunics, and flesh. And Aristotle rightly compares old age to a withering plant. For plants, too, when they are young, are soft and moist; but as they age, they are seen to become progressively drier; and at their end, they are completely dried out, and this for them is death.\n\nThat old age is the driest of the ages is, then, evident from what has been said; that it is also the coldest is even more manifest, so that no one would dispute this point. For to the touch the old feel cold, and they are easily chilled, and they turn black and livid, and are readily afflicted by cold diseases: apoplexies, paralyses, torpor, tremors, spasms, catarrhs, and bronchial ailments. Almost all of their blood has been lost, and for this reason the redness of their complexion has been lost along with it. And their digestion, distribution of nutriment, blood production, assimilation, and nutrition, as well as their appetite, sensation, and movement, are all faint and in a poor state. For what else is old age but a road to death? So that if death is the extinguishing of the innate heat, old age would be a kind of wasting away of it.\n\nHowever, concerning the age of children and of those in their prime, there is no agreement among physicians, nor is it easy to judge their dispute. For the arguments of both sides are plausible: both of those who declare children to be hotter than those in their prime, and of those who, contrary to these, declare those in their prime to be hotter than children. For the first group reasons that the humor of the blood is the hottest of all things that exist naturally in a living being; then, that fetuses at first are almost nothing but blood, and later, as the parts are being formed, one part becomes bone, another artery, another vein, and another something else, all of them red and partaking of a great deal of the purest and hottest blood; from this they conclude that the fetus is hottest. And if this is so, then children, inasmuch as they are nearer to fetuses, are hotter than those in their prime. But the other group argues that while there is much blood in those in their prime, and more than in children (so that for this reason they suffer from constant hemorrhages), the humor of yellow bile, being much hotter than blood, is also most abundant in them, and for this reason they declare those in their prime to be hotter than children.\n\nAgain, arguing from the functions [energeiai], the first group says that because children grow, and desire and consume more food than is proportional to their body, the heat in them is strong. But the other group says that their growth is due more to moisture than to the strength of their heat, and that in digestion they are not only not superior, but are far inferior to those in their prime. For they have vomiting of undigested food and bowel movements that are liquid, coarse, and lacking in chyle. And if they desire more food, this, they say, has nothing to do with the strength of their heat. For in the first place, living beings do not desire food from an excess of heat, but quite the contrary, from a cooling of the appetitive parts; and in the second place, because their nourishment is allocated not only for nutrition but also for growth, for this reason they require more food. And furthermore, they say that in all other functions children are very clearly inferior to those in their prime. For they cannot walk, or run, or carry loads, or perform any of the practical functions equally well; and they say that both sensations and thoughts reach their peak of excellence in those in their prime. In short, the one is still an incomplete living being, while the other is already complete. And in complete beings, they say, it is reasonable that the most active and ruling of the elements should predominate. Moreover, one can see that sleep is most frequent in children, but least frequent in those in their prime. And yet no one, they say, unless he were mad, would suppose that sleep occurs in any other way than by the heat being somehow overcome and weighed down by a multitude of moisture, as can be seen both from those who are drunk and from those who have bathed too much. In this way also the poppy is sleep-inducing, and mandrake, and lettuce, and all things whose temperament [krasis] is moister and colder.\n\nSuch are the disputes from either side concerning the temperament of the ages in question. For to go through all of them seems to me to be superfluous, since the type of arguments has already been made clear even from what we have said. For both sides reason about the former from a distance and, as it were, from secondary things, and they make their arguments as if their listeners already knew how growth, digestion, and nutrition occur. In the same way they discourse on sensation, movement, and practical and natural functions, and they mention the generation of sleep and the nature of foods, none of which is simple and easily known, but requires a great deal of investigation and perhaps cannot even be discovered unless one first knows how to recognize a moist, dry, hot, and cold temperament. For whatever of those things they may speak of as if they already know it, if someone were to compel them to prove it, they would certainly need the theory of temperaments which is our present topic. So their proofs proceed through one another and from one another: they argue from the things now under investigation, as if they were already known, whenever they discuss the functions and discover the power of foods and drugs, and examine sleep and other such things. And then again, they prove the things now before us by means of those other things, as if they were already known beforehand. I do not praise such proofs, but, to speak the truth, I do not even consider them to be proofs, as I have shown at greater length in other works. And I say it is better, in all teaching, to establish the order of the concepts.\n\nIf, therefore, the beginning of the entire subject of temperaments is the investigation of the elements—whether they are completely impassive and unchangeable, or are capable of being altered and changed—and if, after the knowledge of those, the theory now before us is second in order, one must not take proofs for it from things not yet known. Rather, as is right and just, what is taken for the proof ought to be either one of the self-evident things or one of the things previously proven. Therefore, one must not mention the generation of sleep, nor digestion, nor growth, nor anything else of the sort, but the inquiry should proceed from the bare and simple substance of the underlying things, just as we have done through the first book. For having made the distinction that what exists in actuality [kat’ energeian] is one thing, and what exists in potentiality [kata dynamin] is another, we said that one must first make the argument about that which is already hot, cold, dry, and moist in actuality; and then, in this way, arrive at the things that are so in potentiality. The diagnosis of things that are already hot, cold, moist, and dry in actuality is ready at hand and familiar to all. For touch is by nature suited to distinguish such things, the very sense that taught us that fire is hot and crystal is cold. If they have from some other source a conception and diagnosis of hot and cold, let them tell us; for they profess some impossible wisdom, or rather, to tell the truth, some madness, if for perceptible things they have some criterion more venerable than perception itself. And indeed, if no other criterion is possible for things that are hot in actuality, let them now touch in succession many men—old men, youths, children, and infants. In this way they will discover those who are more and less hot.\n\nBut if they seek logical proofs for perceptible things, it is time to consider something about snow itself—whether it should be considered white, as it appears to all men, or not white, as Anaxagoras declared. And indeed, one must likewise investigate pitch and the raven, and all other things. For surely the eyes are not to be disbelieved when they see something white, but to be trusted without proof in the case of black things. Therefore, declaring all the objects of the senses to be untrustworthy, let them not say that the swan is white, unless they first investigate it with reason, nor the lime, nor the day, nor the sun itself. And in this way let them also distrust hearing with regard to sounds, and the nostrils with regard to smells, and touch with regard to all tangible things. Is this not then Pyrrhonian perplexity and endless nonsense? And surely it was not right for those who chose the best school in philosophy—the one that posits the hot, the cold, the dry, and the moist as principles and elements—to stray so far from the men who established these things as not to know that the principles of all proof are things evident to sense and to intellect, and that whoever is perplexed about these things seeks in vain about the others, having left himself not even a place from which to begin. How then did they turn to so long a wandering, and attempt to seek by reason the diagnosis of perceptible things, I for one cannot even conceive. And for this reason I judge by touch that which is hot in actuality; but if something is not yet hot, but is suited to become so—which is called hot in potentiality—this I try to discover by reason. But for them, I know not how, everything has been turned upside-down, and a long rhetoric has been practiced concerning their arguments. Let us, then, leave these men, reminding ourselves just this much for now: that the single origin of faulty doctrines is to have considered nothing beforehand about proof, but to investigate things and, as if knowing what proof is, to attempt to prove them.\n\nReturning, then, again to the subject before us, let us judge by touch, first and foremost, the heat according to the ages. And our judgment will be best in the case of one and the same body of a single infant. For it is not impossible to remember what sort of heat he had when he was at a certain age, and what sort it is now, after two or three years, perhaps, have passed in between. For if any change at all toward hot or cold should appear to have occurred in the infant, it is no longer difficult to deduce the superiority [of heat] that will exist up to the prime of life. And if you should wish to compare several children with many people in their prime, compare thin with thin, fleshy with fleshy, and fat with fat; and in this way also those with similar complexions, and everything else as much as possible. For in seeking to discover the difference among the ages, you would investigate more safely in the case of natures that are as similar as possible. To examine in the case of opposites involves no small fallacy",

      "openai_translation": "Of hot and cold, then, touch of the body alone is the judge; but of moist and dry, along with touch there is need of reasoning. For the dry is in every case hard; this, indeed, is perceptible by touch. Yet not everything that is hard is straightaway dry. For hardness is inseparable from a dry body, but it is not the peculiar property of this alone; a thing congealed by cold is also hard, like crystal. Hence one must not immediately attempt the discrimination of dry and moist before examining how the thing stands with respect to heat or cold. For if something is hard along with extreme cold, it is not thereby already dry; nor, if something is exceedingly soft along with intense heat, is it at once moist. Rather, when it is moderately warm, one should next consider whether it is soft or hard: if soft, it is moist; if hard, dry.\n\nBut if things were so without qualification, none of the hard parts in the human body would be moist. For within it there cannot arise so great a cold as to harden something by congelation. What is initially fluid will indeed come at some point to a certain consistency, as fat [pimelē]; for the oily component in the blood, being fluid and unctuous, when it comes into a cold place, congeals—yet even so it does not become hard. It has therefore been rightly said by the ancients that fat is the moistest, and next after it the fleshy kind, of which there are several forms. First is what is properly called “flesh,” which you would not find anywhere in the body by itself, but it is always a part of muscle. Next in order is the peculiar substance of each of the viscera. Those around Erasistratus call this the parenchyma [parénchyma], and they think of it as a small and trifling matter, not knowing that the specific activity of each viscus belongs to this flesh.\n\nBut this is not yet the time for such things. That the very substance proper to the brain and, next to it, the lung is nearer to fat in moistness may be inferred from its softness. For it has not been congealed by cold, since it is not liquefied by heat either. Very near to these also is marrow in its nature, though the marrow in each bone is not homogeneous with the brain and spinal marrow; brain and spinal marrow are of the same kind, whereas all the other marrows are of a different nature. The brain is more moist and warmer than the spinal marrow, and for this reason softer as well; and even within the brain itself the anterior parts are so much the more moist as they are the more soft.\n\nAll these, however, are not only moister than the skin, but also colder; and, generally, everything without blood is colder than any that has blood. Very close to the skin, too, is the nature of the soft “nerves” [neura: sinews/nerve-like cords], while that of the hard ones is like the skin itself as regards moistness and dryness. In warmth they fall short by as much as is reasonable for a wholly bloodless body to fall short of one with blood. The flesh of the spleen, kidneys, and liver is moister than the skin by as much as it is also softer, and warmer by as much as it has more blood. Indeed, the flesh of the heart is drier than all these by as much as it is harder, and warmer not only than these, but than absolutely all the parts of the body. And you can learn this clearly by sense in the dissections of animals made at the breast, if you insert your fingers into the left ventricle of the heart; you will find that this region is by no small degree warmer than all the others.\n\nThe flesh of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung is simple in nature, with the arteries, veins, and “nerves” appropriate to each viscus ramifying through it. The flesh of the heart, however, is not of a simple kind; rather, just as there are fibers [ines] in the muscles, in which the flesh has set, so too in the heart. Only, the genus of the fibers is not the same: those in the muscles are parts of “nerves” and ligaments, whereas the fibers of the heart are of a peculiar kind—just as is the coat [chitōn] of the artery and of the vein, and those of the intestines, stomach, uterus, and both bladders. In all these organs, then, one may see the proper flesh set around their own proper fibers.\n\nThese fleshes are warmer than the skin; the fibers, some a little more and some less, are a little colder and drier than the skin, and some are altogether like the substance of the skin. All membranes [hymenes] are already drier than the skin, as indeed are the meninges around the brain and spinal marrow; for these too are membranes. And all ligaments, inasmuch as they are harder than the skin, are by so much also drier. Tendons, though softer than ligaments, are plainly already harder than the skin. After the ligaments come the cartilages; there is also an intermediate body between the two which some anatomists call the neurochondral ligament—this is a ligament that is hard and cartilaginous. Bone is the driest",

For the dry is always hard; but while this is perceptible by touch, not everything that is hard is immediately dry. For hardness is inseparable from a dry body, yet it is not peculiar to this alone. For what is frozen by cold is also hard, like ice. Therefore one should not immediately attempt to diagnose dry and moist before examining how it stands with respect to heat or cold. For neither if something is hard with extreme cold is it thereby dry, nor if something is soft with intense heat is it immediately moist. But when it is moderately warm, one should then examine whether it is soft or hard. For if it is soft, it is moist, and if hard, dry.\n\nBut if these things are so, none of the hard parts in the human body would be moist. For it is not possible for such cooling to occur in it that something would be hardened through freezing. For what was previously fluid will sometimes reach a certain consistency, like fat. For the oily element in blood, being fluid and greasy, when it comes to be in a cold place, congeals, yet does not become hard even so. Therefore it has been rightly stated by the ancients that fat is the moistest, and second after it is the fleshy genus, of which there are several species. First is what is properly called flesh, which you could not find anywhere in the body by itself, but is always part of a muscle. Next is the particular substance of each of the viscera. The followers of Erasistratus call this \"parenchyma\" [literally \"that which is poured in beside\"], and they think of it as something small and trivial, not knowing that the function of each organ belongs to this flesh. But now is not yet the time for these matters.\n\nThat the particular body of the brain and lung comes next after fat in moisture can be inferred from their softness. For they have not been frozen by cold, since they are not melted by heat either. Close to these in nature is also the marrow, though the marrow in each bone is not of the same kind as the brain and spinal cord. For brain and spinal cord are of the same genus; but all other marrows are of a different nature. The brain is moister and warmer than the spinal cord, and therefore also softer; and indeed the front parts of the brain itself are as much moister as they are softer. All these things are not only moister than skin but also colder, and in general everything bloodless is colder than what has blood.\n\nThe nature of soft nerves is very close to skin; that of hard nerves is like skin itself, obviously in terms of moisture and dryness. For it falls short in heat by as much as is reasonable for something completely bloodless to fall short of a body with blood. The flesh of the spleen, kidneys, and liver is moister than skin by as much as it is softer; and warmer by as much as it has more blood. Moreover, the flesh of the heart is drier than all these by as much as it is harder; and warmer not only than these but than absolutely all parts of the body. You can clearly learn this by sensation in dissections of animals made through the sternum, by inserting your fingers into the left ventricle of the heart; for you will find this place not a little warmer than all the others.\n\nBut the flesh of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung is simple in nature, having grown around the arteries, veins, and nerves in each organ. The flesh of the heart is not of a simple type, but just as there are fibers in muscles around which the flesh has solidified, such are also in the heart. Except the genus of fibers is not the same, but those in muscles are parts of nerves and ligaments. The genus of fibers in the heart is peculiar, as is also that of the coat of the artery and vein, and of the intestines, stomach, uterus, and both bladders. For indeed in all these organs one can see the proper flesh solidified around their particular fibers. These fleshes, then, are warmer than skin, while the fibers, some more and some less, are slightly colder and drier than skin, and some are entirely similar to the substance of skin.\n\nAll membranes are already drier than skin, as are also the meninges around the brain and spinal cord; for these too are membranes. And indeed all ligaments, to the extent they are harder than skin, are also drier. And tendons, even if they are softer than ligaments, are clearly already harder than skin. Cartilages come after ligaments. And there is a body intermediate between both; some anatomists call this a \"neurochondroid ligament.\" This is a hard and cartilaginous ligament. Bone is the driest of all, which the skin covers. And of the things projecting from it, hair is the driest, next horn, then nails and hooves, spurs, beaks, and whatever such parts exist in each of the irrational animals.\n\nOf the humors, the most useful and most proper is blood. Like a sediment and mud of this is black bile. Therefore it is both colder and thicker than blood; yellow bile is much warmer. The coldest and moistest of all things in the animal is phlegm. Touch is the criterion for diagnosing this too, as Hippocrates has done in his work \"On the Nature of Man.\" But that it is cold, touch alone recognizes; that it is also moist, touch together with sight and reasoning. Touch and sight, because it appears such to each; reasoning, by determining that it became such not through abundance of heat but through innate moisture. This, then, is how it stands concerning the parts and humors of the body.",

For what is dry is in every case hard, and this, on the one hand, is perceptible by touch; however, it is not the case that if something is hard, it is on that account immediately also dry. For hardness is inseparable from a dry body, yet it is not a property peculiar to it alone. For what has been solidified by cold is also hard, such as ice [κρύσταλλος]. For this reason, one must not immediately attempt to diagnose the dry and the moist before first examining its state with regard to heat or cold. For if a thing is hard in conjunction with extreme cold, it is not on that account dry; nor, if it is soft in conjunction with intense heat, is it immediately moist. Rather, when it is moderately warm, one must then consider whether it is soft or hard. For if it is soft, it is moist, and if hard, dry.\n\nBut if this were the case, none of the hard parts in the human body would be moist.

All these parts, however, are not only moister than skin, but also colder, and in general, every bloodless part is colder than a blood-filled one. Very near to the skin is the nature of the soft nerves; but that of the hard nerves is like the skin itself, clearly with respect to moistness and dryness. For in heat it is deficient to the degree that it is reasonable for a completely bloodless body to be deficient compared to a blood-filled one. The flesh of the spleen, the kidneys, and the liver is moister than skin to the same degree that it is softer, but it is warmer to the degree that it is more full of blood. And indeed, the flesh of the heart is drier than all of these to the same degree that it is harder; and it is warmer not only than these, but simply than all parts of the body. And you can learn this clearly by sense perception during dissections of animals performed on the chest, by inserting your fingers into the left ventricle of the heart; for you will find this place is warmer than all the others by no small amount.\n\nNow, the flesh of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung is simple in its nature, being grown around the arteries, veins, and nerves proper to each organ. But the kind of flesh in the heart is not simple; rather, just as there are fibers in the muscles, around which the flesh is fixed, so too are there in the heart. However, the fibers are not of the same kind, for those in the muscles are parts of nerves and ligaments. But the kind of fibers in the heart is unique, as is that of the coat of an artery and vein, and of the intestines, stomach, uterus, and both bladders. For in all these organs, one can see their own flesh fixed around their own proper fibers. These fleshes, then, are warmer than the skin, while the fibers—some a little more so, others less—are slightly colder and drier than the skin, and some are in every way similar to the substance of the skin. All membranes are drier than skin, as are the meninges around the brain and spinal marrow, for these too are membranes. And indeed, all ligaments, to the extent that they are harder than skin, are to that same extent also drier. And the tendons, even if they are softer than the ligaments, are at any rate clearly harder than skin. Cartilages come after the ligaments. And there is a body intermediate between the two, which some of the anatomists call a neuro-cartilaginous ligament. This is a hard and cartilaginous ligament.

Black bile is, as it were, the sediment and dregs of this. These things [i.e., the dregs] are accordingly both colder and thicker than blood; but yellow bile is by far warmer. Phlegm is the coldest and moistest of all things in the animal. The criterion for its diagnosis is also touch, just as Hippocrates has stated in his work *On the Nature of Man*. But that it is cold, touch alone discerns; that it is also moist, however, is discerned by touch, sight, and reasoning together. Touch and sight, because it appears so to each; and reasoning, by determining that it became such not through an abundance of heat, but through its innate moistness.

      "openai_translation": "Concerning the qualities that follow upon the temperaments, we must next go through them in order. For what was said before also follows, and indeed is absolutely inseparable: to dryness there belongs hardness, and to moisture softness, at least whenever it occurs together with a tepid warmth. And thicknesses of habit and thinnesses likewise attend the temperaments [kraseis: mixtures/constitutions], not only those that are congenital, but even if someone becomes such secondarily through long-established habit. For I have seen many who were naturally slender become thick, and of those who were thick become slender—some, by idleness and luxurious regimen, having shifted their entire temperament to the more moist; others, worn down by greater hardships and cares and by a spare regimen, have been dried out. The marks of these things too will be stated. For it is better that, starting from certain signs, we ourselves should be able to recognize, before learning it from another, whether a man was such by nature, or became so through habit. And the admirable Hippocrates is the teacher of these marks as well as of all the others. For as many as have broader veins are naturally hotter; and as many as have narrower veins, colder. For it is the work of heat to widen and to dilate them. Hence, reasonably, for the most part, narrowness of the veins coincides with a fatty and thicker habit, while a fine habit coincides with breadth of veins. But if someone should be at once fatty and thick and have broad veins, such a person has become fatty through habit, not by nature—just as if one had narrow veins yet were lean, this person too is not of necessity such by nature. And even, he says, in those subject to hunger-attacks [limangchonikoi: prone to spells of faintness from hunger], one must infer the “moderations” [i.e., degrees] from these things—namely the breadth and narrowness of the vessels—and not from the rest of the habit of the whole body. For those whose veins are narrow are poor in blood and cannot endure long fasts; but those whose veins are broad, and who have a quantity of blood, are able to fast without harm. The causes of what has been stated are already clear, even if I do not say them, to those at least who pay attention. But since not everyone pays attention, it is perhaps necessary to say something also on their account.\n\nWhatever in the blood is rich, light, and fine, in the hotter bodies becomes nourishment for the heat, whereas in the colder it is preserved. And when it is filtered outside the veins, if it chances upon cold parts—such as the membranes are—it congeals upon them; but in parts that are naturally hotter (and these are manifestly the fleshy parts), it is consumed by the heat and dissipated, unless sometimes, when the temperament is tending to the colder, the ease of the regimen also fosters fat even upon the fleshy parts themselves. Thus it is that burrowing animals are often found to be fattier; and women more than men, both because the female is colder in temperament than the male, and because they for the most part stay indoors. Therefore, as many bodily habits as are naturally well-tempered and take moderate exercise must become well-fleshed [eusarkoi: proportionately fleshed], that is, everywhere symmetrical. But those for whom the moist element is sufficient and the heat falls not much short of perfect symmetry become very fleshy [polysarkoi]. Very fleshy too are those who are naturally well-tempered yet live lazily and without toil. For this also has been most excellently said by the ancients, that habits are acquired natures. And perhaps it will make no difference, once we have said this once, not to distinguish any longer under each particular heading whether someone is colder by nature or became so through habit, but to leave this to the readers, while I, for brevity’s sake, go through the bodily habits proper to each of the temperaments.\n\nThere are, then, some who are at once lean and have small veins, but if you cut any one of them [i.e., any vein], fat appears, clearly lying under the skin along the inner membrane. Such a case is rare in men, but in women it is found very often indeed; for this is the mark of a colder nature and a more inactive life. Fat [pimelē: adipose tissue] always arises through a cold habit; much flesh [polysarkia] is the offspring of a quantity of blood; well-fleshedness [eusarkia] is the mark of a well-tempered nature. In general, then, those who are very fleshy at once have more fat than those who are well-tempered; yet fat does not always grow in proportion to the flesh, but one may see among the stout some having more flesh and others more fat, while in some both have increased alike. In those, then, in whom both have increased alike, there is so much more moisture beyond the well-tempered nature as there is also more cold. In those in whom the fat is greater, the cold is in these cases greater than the moisture; whereas in those whose flesh is greater, there is an excess of moisture beyond what is fitting, but not of cold. For whenever, while the native heat remains within its proper bounds, there is an increase of good blood, it is necessary that much flesh should follow. How much more than the symmetrical measure the blood must be cannot be signified by measure and weight, but it can be set out by reasoning: namely, so long as no diseased symptom has yet arisen in the animal’s body as it grows stout, the excess of moisture is then within the limits of health. For it has been shown by us elsewhere that it is necessary to assume no small latitude of the healthy condition. And even now it appears, almost throughout this discussion, that we always set the well-tempered and middle nature as the rule for the others, while those that deviate to either side of it we declare to be ill-tempered; which would not be the case if the healthy condition did not admit of “more and less.” For one ill-temper is healthy, another diseased: diseased, that which has departed farthest from the well-tempered; healthy, that which has departed only a little. It is not possible even here to define the amount by measure and weight; but a sufficient mark of the healthy ill-temper is that none of the animal’s activities has yet been clearly impaired. The extent, then, that lies between acting at one’s peak and activity being clearly impaired—so great is the latitude both of health and of the ill-temper consistent with it. Next after this comes the diseased ill-temper, whenever indeed the animal is sick on account of ill-temper. For it is not by this alone that it falls sick, but also through many other conditions, concerning which more will be said in our calculations about the differences of diseases; but now we must take up again the argument from the beginning.\n\nFor just as, when the congenital heat keeps the best well-temper, an increase of moisture, so long as it is within healthy bounds, does not make a man fatty but fleshy, the",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 4:**\n\nNow we must discuss in sequence the things that follow from the temperaments. For the aforementioned things also follow, or rather are completely inseparable: hardness follows dryness, and softness follows moisture, at least when it is accompanied by lukewarm heat. But both thickness and thinness of bodily condition follow temperaments, not only the innate ones, but also if someone should acquire one through long habit. For I have observed many naturally thin people become thick, and thick people become thin, some having altered their entire temperament toward the moister through idleness and luxurious living, others having been dried out through many hardships, anxieties, and thin diet. The signs of these will also be stated. For it is better that we ourselves, starting from certain signs, should be able to recognize—before learning from another—whether the person was such by nature or became so through habit. The teacher of these signs, as indeed of all others, is the marvelous Hippocrates. For those who have broader veins are warmer by nature; those who have narrower ones are colder. For it is the work of heat to widen and dilate these. So it reasonably follows that, for the most part, narrowness of veins coincides with a fatty and thicker bodily condition, while thinness of condition coincides with breadth of veins. But if someone should be both fatty and thick while having broad veins, this person became fatty through habit, not by nature; just as if someone should have narrow veins but be lean, neither is this person necessarily such by nature. \"And in those suffering from famine,\" he says, \"one must consider the moderate conditions from these\"—namely from the breadth and narrowness of the vessels, not from the other condition of the whole body. For those having narrow veins both have little blood and do not tolerate long fasting; but those with broad veins and abundance of blood can fast without harm. The causes of what has been said are already clear, even if I do not state them, at least to those paying attention. But since not everyone pays attention, it is perhaps necessary to say something for their sake too. Whatever in the blood is fatty, light, and thin becomes nourishment for the heat in warmer bodies, but is preserved in colder ones. And when it filters outside the veins, when it encounters cold parts such as membranes, it congeals around them; but in naturally warmer parts (such are clearly the fleshy parts), it is consumed by the heat and dispersed, unless sometimes, in addition to the colder temperament, the ease of lifestyle should also nourish fat even in the fleshy parts themselves. Thus hibernating animals are often found to be fattier. And women [are fattier] than men, because the female is colder in temperament than the male and mostly stays at home. Therefore, those bodily conditions that are well-tempered by nature and exercise moderately must necessarily become well-fleshed, that is, proportionate in every way. But those in which the moisture is sufficient but the heat falls not far short of perfect proportion become very fleshy. Also very fleshy are those who are well-tempered by nature but live lazily and without toil. For this too has been excellently stated by the ancients, that habits are acquired natures. And perhaps it will make no difference, having said this once now, to no longer distinguish in each heading whether someone became colder by nature or through habit, but to leave this to the readers, and for the sake of brevity to go through the bodily conditions proper to each of the temperaments. There are indeed some who are both lean and have small veins, but if you cut any part of them, fat appears, clearly having grown beneath the skin along the inner membrane. This is rare in men but very often found in women. For it is a sign both of a colder nature and of a more idle life. For fat always comes about through cooling of the condition; abundance of flesh is offspring of abundance of blood; and good flesh is a sign of a well-tempered nature. Therefore, the very fleshy always have more fat than the well-tempered; yet fat does not always increase proportionally with flesh, but one can see among the thick some having more flesh, others having more fat, and in some both have increased similarly. In those in whom both have increased similarly, the moisture exceeds the well-tempered nature by as much as the cold does. In those with more fat, the cold exceeds more than the moisture; just as in those with more flesh, there is more moisture than necessary, but not also cooling. For when, with heat remaining within its proper limits, there occurs an excess of good blood, abundance of flesh must necessarily follow. But how much the blood should exceed the moderate amount cannot be indicated by measure and weight, but can be explained by reason. When no morbid symptom yet occurs in the animal's body as it becomes thick, the abundance of moisture is then within the limits of health. For it has been demonstrated by us elsewhere that it is necessary to assume a considerable range of the healthy state. But even now it appears throughout almost the entire discussion, as we always posit the well-tempered and middle nature as a standard for the others, that those on either side of this we declare dyscrastic; which would not be the case if the healthy state did not admit of more and less. For there is one healthy dyscrasia and another morbid dyscrasia; the morbid is that which has departed furthest from the well-tempered, the healthy that which has departed little. And here too it is not possible to define the amount by measure and weight; but a sufficient sign of healthy dyscrasia is that no function of the animal has yet been clearly impaired. Therefore, whatever exists between functioning perfectly and having a function clearly impaired, so great is both the range of health and of the dyscrasia according to it. Following this is morbid dyscrasia, when the animal is ill through dyscrasia. For not through this alone, but also through not a few other conditions, about which more will be said in the discussions on the differences of diseases; but now we must again take up the argument from the beginning. For just as, when the innate heat maintains the best temperament and moisture increases within healthy limits, it makes the person not fatty but very fleshy, with fat also increasing slightly but flesh to a much greater degree; so again, if the moist and dry maintain exact proportion to each other but the person is less warm, this body must necessarily become more fatty than fleshy. But if again the heat should increase while the other opposition remains in proportion, this animal lacks fat more than flesh; just as, if the dry should ever prevail while the other opposition remains in proportion, the body will be both leaner and harder. These things have been said by me, and it is already clear that not only have the simple dyscrasias been shown by reason to exist in animal bodies, but the signs of all are clear; not only in heat and cold, and softness and hardness, but also in all the other differences of the condition of the whole body, of which concerning thinness and thickness has now been spoken, and concerning the others let us now speak.",

For the qualities previously mentioned also follow from them—or rather, they are completely inseparable: hardness from the dry, and softness from the moist, at least when the latter is accompanied by a gentle warmth. But stoutness and thinness of bodily state also follow from temperaments—not only from innate ones, but also from any acquired temperament that may arise from long-standing habit. For I have observed many who are naturally thin become stout, and many who are stout become thin: the former altering their entire temperament toward the moister through inactivity and a luxurious diet, the latter being dried out by many hardships, anxieties, and a spare diet.\n\nThe signs for distinguishing these will also be described. For it is better for us to be able, starting from certain signs, to recognize for ourselves whether a person was of such a kind by nature or became so from habit, before having to learn it from another. And the teacher of these signs—as indeed of all others—is the marvelous Hippocrates. For those who have wider veins are hotter by nature, while those with narrower ones are colder. For it is the function of the hot quality to widen and expand them. Thus, it is reasonable that, for the most part, narrowness of the veins coincides with a fatty and stouter constitution, while thinness of constitution coincides with wideness of the veins. But if someone were at once fatty and stout, yet had wide veins, this person became fatty through habit, not by nature. Likewise, if someone had narrow veins but was lean, he too is not necessarily of such a kind by nature. And \"in cases of starvation,\" he [Hippocrates] says, \"one must judge the proper measures from these things\"—that is, clearly, from the wideness or narrowness of the vessels, not from the general state of the whole body. For those who have narrow veins have little blood and cannot bear long periods of fasting; but those who have wide veins and an abundance of blood can go without food without harm.\n\nThe causes of what has been said are already clear, even if I do not state them, at least to those who are paying attention. But since not everyone pays attention, it is perhaps necessary to say something for their sake as well. Whatever in the blood is rich, light, and fine becomes nourishment for the innate heat in hotter bodies, but is preserved in colder ones.

This is indeed why hibernating animals are often found to be fatter, and why women are fatter than men—because the female is both colder in temperament than the male and for the most part stays at home.\n\nTherefore, those bodily constitutions that are well-tempered by nature and undergo moderate exertion must necessarily become well-fleshed [eúsarkos], that is, symmetrical in every way. But those in which the moist is sufficient, while the hot falls not far short of perfect symmetry, become very fleshy [polýsarkos]. And those who are well-tempered by nature but live idly and without exertion also become very fleshy. For this too was most excellently stated by the ancients: that habits are acquired natures. And perhaps, having stated this once, it will make no difference for us not to distinguish further in each section whether a particular person became so by nature or from habit, but rather to leave this to the readers, while I, for the sake of brevity, proceed to describe the bodily states proper to each temperament.\n\nThere are, to be sure, some people who are at once lean and have small veins, but if you were to cut any one of them, fat appears, clearly having grown beneath the skin along the inner membrane.

      "openai_translation": "Rough [dense/coarse] is the hot and dry krasis [mixture/temperament], but this is so in the extreme; moderately so is the temperament that is hot yet proportionate with respect to the other opposition; just as, too, the dry temperament is well-balanced with respect to the hot and the cold; for this too is moderately rough. All the cold tempers produce fine [scant] hairs, whether they possess moisture in excess or in moderation. But in the highest degree hairless is the cold and moist krasis; less so than this is the cold temperament that is at the same time well-balanced with respect to the other opposition; and still less so is the cold and dry.\n\nAnd yet someone will suppose—since on dry ground grasses can neither sprout, nor be nourished, nor grow—that the same argument holds for hairs on the skin; but it is not so. For “dry earth” is said so as earth, while “skin” is spoken of as skin. Accordingly, what is dry in earth is in the extreme unfruitful; but what is in the body of a human being, and of animals like the human, is not unfruitful, but suitable and most of all apt for the generation of hairs. For from shell-skinned and hard-shelled creatures, such as oysters, and crabs, and crayfish, and from all scaly animals, like snakes, or those with small scales, like fishes, hair could not come to be; for their skins are truly completely dry, like a sort of shell or stone. From soft-skinned creatures, however—for example, a human being—the drier and hotter the skin is, by so much the more does it admit the growth of hairs. For, to follow the example to which they appeal and keep to the analogy of earth, grasses are able to grow neither in very dry and parched ground nor in wet and marshy ground; rather, when the excess of moisture begins to be spent, they spring forth from the earth; they grow further when this too dries, moderately so in the spring, most quickly and to the greatest extent at the beginning of summer; and they wither when the earth has been completely dried out, in midsummer.\n\nAnd you may, if you like, just as was shown somewhere in the argument before this, liken spring—because it is the most well-tempered of the seasons—to a naturally well-tempered skin, especially the middle part of that season; for then the earth too is in a sort of middle condition of moisture and dryness. And the parts of the spring season that adjoin summer already have the earth drier than is proportionate, and still more so at the beginning of summer. The hot and dry skin I am talking about you might best compare to the condition of the earth that comes to be at the end of spring or the beginning of summer. For when summer is at its height, it becomes extremely dry, like the animals with shell-like skins—yet not so for humans, or swine, or asses, or horses, or any of the hairy animals. So if they wish to compare skin to the earth, by this account they will find it agreeing with what we previously said. But they, beguiled by homonymy, fall into a sophism. For when we said that in dry and hot skin many and large hairs grow, we were making the argument manifestly about a human being or a hairy animal, not about oysters and crabs.\n\nEvery skin always breathes out something, the heat drawing along with itself no small portion of the internal moisture. But where the skin is moist and exactly soft—like cheese that has just set—the passageways for what passes through do not hold, because the parts that had previously been separated reunite with one another; whereas where it is already hard, like cheese that has set, it is pierced by the rush of what is going out, and being unable to be knit back together because of the dryness, it keeps the pores always open, and even more tunnel-like through the continual blows of what flows through. If, then, what flows through is either vapor or pure liquid, the course of the vapor is quick and unhindered, whereas the liquid often gets held up in the smaller pores and is compelled to rebound back inward into the depth. But if the exhalation is sooty and thick and earthy, there is often a danger, when it is wedged into the narrow outlets, that it can neither easily creep back inward nor be able to be voided. Another such exhalation then, rising again from the depth, strikes and pushes it forward, and again another pushes that one, and another pushes the other. And so conceive that many sooty exhalations, being wedged one upon another, are over time being entwined and conjoined, and making a single mass of such a sort as soot is outside, except that, by as much as it is compacted, by so much is it exactly compressed, packed tight by the narrowness of the outlet. And when this body has completely blocked the pore, it is from that point on struck forcibly by similar residues which have no outlet, and as a whole it is pushed forward in this place, so that it is even compelled to protrude from the skin, now become strap-like. The part wedged in the pore is like a root of a blade of grass or of a plant, and what projects from the skin is like the plant itself.\n\nHair is black when, the exhalation being burned together by the strength of the heat, the residue becomes a fine soot; it is blond when it is less thoroughly baked; for then the sludge-like residue wedged in is of yellow bile, not of black [bile]. White hair is offspring of phlegm. Reddish hair, just as in color it is between blond and white, so too in its generation is between phlegmatic and bilious sludge.\n\nHairs become woolly either because of the dryness of the krasis, or because of the pore in which they are rooted: on account of dryness, in a way similar to straps that have been dried too much by fire. And really, what need is there to mention straps, when you can see the hairs themselves, if they are brought near fire, immediately twisting? Thus all Ethiopians are woolly-haired. As for the nature of the pores in which they are rooted, it is as follows. Often the exhalation, unable because of weakness to travel straight, has twisted in just the way it could and formed the pore accordingly. Sometimes, however, the exhalation is vigorous, but being hindered from proceeding straight by the nature of the skin, which is harder than is fitting, it turns aside to the slant, as one can see even in a furnace, not only vapor or smoke but even the flames themselves, when shut off from their upward course, splitting obliquely to either side. Thus also the exhalation from the body, whenever it is blocked in some way and hindered from moving outward, makes an oblique passage under the skin until, accumulated over a longer time, it forces its way and breathes out to the outside. Sometimes, when both conditions come together—the initial exhalation that fashioned the pore being weak, and the skin being dry—the roots of the hairs become oblique. And as they are molded in their rooting, such is it reasonable for them to remain forever; for indeed nothing else among hard and dry bodies can be straightened without first being softened. Such, then, is the generation of hairs. Next it would be in order to state the causes of all the accidents that befall the kraseis in the differences of hairs according to age and region and bodily constitution.",

All cold temperaments are bare of hair, whether they have excessive moisture or moderate moisture. But the cold and moist temperament is extremely hairless; less so than this is the one that is cold and at the same time well-tempered in the other opposition; and still less the cold and dry. Yet someone might think that, just as it is impossible for grasses to grow, be nourished, and increase in dry earth, the same reasoning applies to hairs on the skin; but this is not so. For earth is called dry qua earth, but skin qua skin. And therefore what is dry in earth is extremely without moisture; but what is dry in a human body, and in animals similar to humans, is not without moisture, and is especially suited of all things for the generation of hair. For from shell-skinned and soft-shelled creatures, such as oysters, crayfish, and crabs, and whatever scaly animals there are, like snakes, or scaled creatures, like fish, hair could not grow; for their skins are truly completely dry like some shell or stone. But from soft-skinned creatures, such as humans, the drier and hotter the skin is, the more it is possible for hair to grow. For, to use the example of earth as they challenge us to do, grasses cannot grow in very dry and parched earth, nor in moist and marshy earth, but when the excess moisture begins to be consumed, they sprout from the earth; and they grow more when it dries out, moderately in spring, but most quickly and extensively at the beginning of summer; they dry up when the earth is completely parched in midsummer. And you may, if you wish, even now, as was shown in the previous discussion, liken spring, being the most temperate of the seasons, to the nature of temperate skin, and especially the middle of this season; for at that time the earth is somehow intermediate between moisture and dryness. But those parts of the spring season that border on summer already have earth drier than the moderate level, and still more so at the beginning of summer. What I therefore call hot and dry skin, you might best liken to the condition of earth occurring at the end of spring or beginning of summer. For in midsummer it becomes extremely dry, similar to that of shell-skinned animals, but not of humans, or pigs, or donkeys, or horses, or any other hairy animals. So if they wish to compare skin to earth, they will find in this reasoning too agreement with what we said before. But they deceive themselves, being sophisticatedly misled by the ambiguity of terms. For we said that in dry and hot skin many and large hairs grow, obviously making our argument about humans or hairy animals, not about oysters and crabs. For something is always transpired through each skin by heat carrying along with itself no small amount of internal moisture. But in skin that is moist and perfectly soft, like newly curdled cheese, the passages of what has passed through do not remain, as the parts that were previously separated unite with each other again; but in skin that is already hard, similar to solidified cheese, it is perforated by the force of what exits, and being unable to unite due to dryness, it maintains permanent pores, which become more tube-like from the continuous impacts of what flows through. Now if what flows through is either vapor or pure liquid, the vapor has a quick and unimpeded passage; but the liquid is often held in the smaller pores and is sometimes forced to flow back inward to the depths. But if the exhalation is sooty, thick, and earthy, there is often danger that it will become wedged in the narrow passages, neither easily able to return inward nor able to be evacuated. This then is struck and pushed forward by another such exhalation rising from the depths, and this again by another, and that by yet another. And thus understand that many sooty exhalations wedged upon one another over time become entangled and joined together, creating some single body like soot on the outside, except that, to the extent it is compressed, it is also precisely constricted, being pressed by the narrowness of the passage. When such a body blocks the entire pore, thereafter being forcibly struck by similar waste products that have no outlet, it is pushed forward entirely in this process, so that it is forced to protrude from the skin, having already become strap-like. The part wedged in the pore resembles something like the root of a grass or plant, while the part already projecting from the skin is like the plant itself. The hair is black when, the exhalation having been burnt by the strength of the heat, the waste product becomes pure soot; blonde when it is less roasted. For then the wedged waste product is the muddy residue of yellow bile, not black bile. White hair is the offspring of phlegm. Red hair, just as in color it is between blonde and white, so also in generation it is between phlegmatic and bilious mud. Curly hairs occur either due to the dryness of the temperament or due to the pore in which they are rooted; due to dryness in a manner similar to leather straps excessively dried by fire. Yet why mention leather straps when we see the hairs themselves, if they come near fire, immediately becoming twisted? Thus all Ethiopians are curly-haired. Due to the nature of the pores in which they are rooted, it happens as follows. Often the exhalation, unable through weakness to travel straight, creates the pore in whatever way it winds. Sometimes the exhalation is strong, but being prevented from moving straight by the nature of the skin, which is harder than appropriate, it turns sideways, just as one can see outside not only vapor or smoke but even flames themselves, when blocked from upward movement, splitting obliquely to either side. Thus also the exhalation from the body, when it is confined somewhere and prevented from moving outward, creates an oblique passage under the skin, until, having accumulated over a longer time, it forces its way and breathes out to the exterior. Sometimes when both factors coincide—weakness of the first exhalation that created the pore and dryness of the skin—obliqueness occurs in the roots of the hairs. Whatever form they take in their rooting, such they naturally remain forever. For it is not possible to straighten any other hard and dry bodies without first softening them. This then is the generation of hair. Next would be to state the causes of all the conditions that occur to temperaments in the differences of hair according to age, region, and bodily nature.",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 5**\n\nThe hot and dry temperament [κρᾶσις] is hairy, but this is so to an extreme degree. Moderately hairy, however, is the temperament that is hot but balanced [σύμμετρος] with respect to the other opposition [i.e., wet and dry]; this is also the case for the temperament that is dry but well-tempered [εὔκρατος] with respect to hot and cold, for this too is moderately hairy. On the other hand, all the cold temperaments are bare of hair, whether they possess moisture immoderately or moderately. But the cold and wet temperament is the most extremely hairless; less so than this is the temperament that is cold and at the same time well-tempered with respect to the other opposition; and even less so is the cold and dry temperament.\n\nAnd yet, one might think that just as it is impossible for grasses to sprout, be nourished, and grow in dry earth, the same principle applies to hairs in the skin. But it is not so. For earth is called dry *as earth*, while skin is called dry *as skin*. And so, what is dry in earth is extremely devoid of moisture [ἄνικμον]; but what is dry in the body of a human, and of animals similar to humans, is not devoid of moisture, but is suitable—and indeed most suitable of all—for the generation of hairs. For hair could not grow from the hard-shelled and crustacean animals, such as oysters, crayfish, and crabs, nor from any of the scaly animals, such as snakes, or the scale-covered ones, such as fish; for the skins of these are truly completely dry, like a potsherd or a rock. From the soft-skinned animals, however, such as man is, the drier and hotter the skin is, the more it is possible for hairs to grow.\n\nFor, to follow the example of the earth, as they propose, it is possible for grasses to grow neither in very dry and drought-ridden earth, nor in wet and marshy earth. Rather, when the excess moisture begins to be used up, they sprout from the earth. They grow more when the earth becomes drier—moderately so in the spring, but most quickly and to the greatest extent at the beginning of summer. They wither, when the earth has become completely parched, in the middle of summer. And you may, if you wish, even now—as was shown somewhere in the preceding discourse—liken the spring, since it is the most well-tempered of the seasons, to the nature of a well-tempered skin, and especially the middle of this season; for at that time the earth is in a mean state, so to speak, of wetness and dryness. But the parts of the spring season that border on summer already have the earth drier than is balanced, and still more so at the beginning of summer. Therefore, what I call a hot and dry skin, you might best liken to the condition of the earth that occurs at the end of spring or the beginning of summer. For in the middle of summer, it becomes extremely dry, like the skin of hard-shelled animals, but not like that of humans, or pigs, or donkeys, or horses, or any other hairy animal.\n\nSo that, if they wish to compare the skin to the earth, they will find that the argument on this point also agrees with what was said by us before. But they, having been deceived by the homonymy [of the word ‘dry’], reason fallaciously. For we said that many large hairs grow in dry and hot skin, obviously making our argument about a human or a hairy animal, not about oysters and crabs.\n\nFor something is always being breathed out through each skin by the innate heat, which carries away with it no small amount of the internal moisture. But in skins that are moist and perfectly soft, like newly setting cheese, the pathways of the things that have passed through do not remain, as the parts of the skin that were previously separated unite with each other again. In skins that are already hard, however, like firm cheese, the skin is pierced by the force of the things exiting, and being unable to unite again on account of its dryness, it keeps the pores remaining open always, and they become more like pipes from the continuous blows of the things flowing through. Now, if what is flowing through is a vapor or a pure liquid, the passage for the vapor is swift and unhindered; but the liquid is often held back in the smaller pores, and some of it is forced to run back again into the depths. But if the exhalation [ἀναθυμίασις] is, as it were, sooty, thick, and earthy, there is a danger that it will often get wedged in the narrowness of the passages, and be able neither to return inward easily nor to be evacuated. Then another such exhalation, rising again from the depths, strikes this one and pushes it forward, and another pushes that one, and still another that one. And so, you must conceive of many sooty exhalations being wedged one after another over time, becoming entangled and joined together, and making a single body of such a kind as soot is on the outside—except that, by as much as it has been condensed, by so much has it also been tightly constricted, having been compressed by the narrowness of the passage. And when it has blocked the entire pore, such a body is from then on struck violently by similar residues that have no exit, and the whole of it is pushed forward in this way, so that it is forced to protrude from the skin, having now become like a leather strap. The part of it wedged in the pore seems like a kind of root of a grass or plant, while the part already projecting from the skin is like the plant itself.\n\nHair is black when, the exhalation having been burnt up by the strength of the heat, the residue becomes true soot. It is blond when it has been less roasted. For in that case the wedged-in residue is a sludge from yellow bile, not black. White hair is an offspring of phlegm. And auburn hair, just as it is intermediate in color between blond and white, so too in its genesis it is intermediate between a phlegmatic and a bilious sludge. Hairs become curly either because of the dryness of the temperament or because of the pore in which they are rooted. Because of dryness, they are like leather straps that have been excessively dried by fire. And yet, why mention straps, when we see that hairs themselves, if they approach a fire, are immediately twisted? It is for this reason, then, that all Ethiopians are curly-haired. The cause can also be the nature of the pores in which they are rooted, in the following ways. Often the exhalation, being unable to travel in a straight line due to weakness, twists in a certain way, and has thus shaped the pore. Sometimes, the exhalation is strong, but being prevented from moving straight by the nature of the skin, which is harder than it ought to be, it is turned to the side—just as it is possible to see externally, not only vapor or smoke, but even flames themselves, when they are blocked from their upward course, splitting into oblique paths on either side. In this way, then, the exhalation from the body, whenever it is blocked in some way and prevented from moving outwards, makes for itself an oblique passage under the skin, until, having gathered in greater quantity over time, it forces its way through and finds an outlet to the outside. And sometimes, when both factors coincide—the weakness of the initial exhalation that created the pore, and the dryness of the skin—the crookedness in the roots of the hairs occurs. And whatever shape they are formed into at their rooting, it is likely they remain so for all time. For it is not possible to straighten any other hard and dry body without first softening it.\n\nThis, then, is the generation of hairs. Next, it would be appropriate to speak of the causes of all the phenomena related to the temperaments in the differences of hairs according to age, region, and the nature of the body.",

Likewise, according to the very natures of bodies, hair is disposed analogously to ages and regions. For very small children are bare of hair, because they do not yet have any pores in their skin nor sooty residues. As they approach puberty, they begin to grow hair that is small and weak; but those in their prime have hair that is stronger, abundant, large, and black, because a multitude of pores has now developed in them, and they are full of sooty residues due to dryness and heat.\n\nThe hair on the head, eyebrows, and eyelids exists in us even as children. For the generation of these is not like that of grass, but like that of plants, primarily fashioned by nature and not necessarily following temperaments, as is shown in the work \"On the Usefulness of Parts.\" Yet even for these, while their existence is due to nature's art, their being either black or reddish or having some other variation necessarily follows the temperament of the age. They are generally somewhat reddish because what is compressed in the pores is not yet entirely black. For the moisture is abundant, the passage easy, and the burning weak. They grow well and are proportionately thick due to the abundance of residues that nourish them. For the part of the body itself where they grow is dry—the entire skull being bony—and the skin surrounding it is as much drier than all the skin on the rest of the body as it is harder. Moreover, no small quantity of sooty residues rises up both from the brain and indeed from the whole body. So what the entire body becomes for those in their prime, such is already the skin of the head for infants.\n\nReasonably then, some become bald as time advances—those whose skin was harder from the beginning. For it has been shown earlier that all parts of those growing old become dry. Indeed, for many the skin becomes shell-like, having dried more than necessary. In such skin nothing can grow, as has been agreed through what was said before. For indeed the insides of the hands, just like the soles of the feet, are always hairless and bare, the tendon beneath them being extremely dry and dense, which underlies the skin.\n\nFor those whose scalp skin does not reach the extreme of dryness, the hair becomes weak and entirely white, which people call gray hair—weak due to lack of proper nourishment, and white because what nourishes them is like a kind of mold from phlegm that has putrefied over time. For when the pore still remains but the residue is scanty and viscous, and is weakly pushed forward by the heat, it undergoes something similar to putrefaction in this process.\n\nAnd indeed people become bald more at the crown as they age, but grow gray more at the temples, because the crown is the driest of all parts of the head—for there the skin lies upon bare bone—while the temples are moister, for there are large muscles beneath the skin there, and every muscle is fleshy, and flesh is moister than bone and skin.",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 5.2:**\n\nEgyptians, then, and Arabs, and Indians, and every nation inhabiting a hot and dry region, have hair that is black, slow-growing, dry, curly, and brittle. But those who, opposite to these, inhabit a moist and cold country—Illyrians and Germans, and Dalmatians, and Sauromatians, and the entire Scythian people—have hair that is moderately fast-growing, fine, straight, and reddish-blond. And those in between these, occupying a well-tempered land, have hair that is fastest-growing and strongest, moderately black, moderately thick, and neither precisely curly nor precisely straight.\n\nAnd so it is also with the ages of life: in infants, hair is like that of the Germans; in those at their prime, like that of the Ethiopians; and in youths and children, like that of the nations inhabiting a well-tempered land. The hair corresponds in strength, thickness, size, and color. And so also, according to the very natures of bodies, hair is disposed analogously to ages and regions. For very small children are bare of hair, because as yet they have no pores in their skin, nor any sooty residues. But as they approach puberty, they grow small and weak hairs; and at their prime, they possess stronger, numerous, large, and black hairs, both because a multitude of pores has now developed in them and because they are full of sooty residues due to dryness and heat.\n\nBut the hairs on the head, eyebrows, and eyelids are already present in us even as children. For their generation is not like that of grasses, but like that of plants, having been worked out by nature according to a primary plan, and not following necessarily from the temperaments [Greek: *kraseis*, the mixture of humors], as is also shown in *On the Usefulness of the Parts*. But even for these hairs, while their existence is due to the art of nature, their being either black, or reddish-blond, or having some other difference, follows necessarily from the temperament of the age. For they are generally somewhat reddish-blond, because the substance wedged in the pores is not yet entirely black. For the moisture is abundant, the passage is easy, and the combustion is weak. They are fast-growing and moderately thick due to the abundance of the residues that nourish them. For the part of the body itself where they grow is dry—for the entire cranium is bony—and the skin surrounding it is drier than all the skin on the rest of the body, by as much as it is also harder. Nevertheless, a considerable quantity of sooty residues is brought up both from the parts around the brain and also from the whole body. Thus, the skin of the head in infants is already of such a kind as the whole body becomes for those in their prime.\n\nReasonably, therefore, some people become bald as time goes on, those for whom the skin was harder from the beginning. For it has been shown before that all the parts of the aging dry out. The skin of many, then, becomes like a potsherd [Greek: *ostrakōdes*], having been dried out more than is necessary. In such a substance nothing can grow, as has also been agreed through the preceding arguments. And indeed, the insides of the hands, just as the undersides of the feet, are always hairless and bare, since the tendon underlying the skin in these parts is extremely dry and dense.\n\nBut for those whose scalp does not arrive at a final state of dryness, their hairs become weak and white—which people call gray hairs [Greek: *poliai*]. They are weak from a lack of their proper nourishment, and white because that which nourishes them is of such a kind, like a sort of mold from phlegm that has putrefied over time. For whenever the pore still remains, but the residue is scanty and viscous, and is pushed forward weakly by the heat, in this it undergoes something akin to putrefaction.\n\nAnd so, as they age, men become bald more on the crown of the head, but they go gray more on the temples, because the former is the driest of all the parts of the head (for in this area the skin is on bare bone), while the temples are moister. For here there are large muscles under the skin, and every muscle is fleshy, and flesh is moister than bone and skin.",

      "openai_translation": "One must pay close attention to what is being said, so that we do not unwittingly mishear something and go astray—just as many of those who are thought to be the very best physicians make mistakes, for when someone is bald they immediately suppose that his whole body has a dry temperament [krasis: mixture/temperament]. One ought not to conjecture so simply; rather, it would have been better first to make a distinction—namely, that among people, some have a body that as a whole is evenly mixed, while in others—and these are not few—it is disposed unevenly. For in such persons, some of the parts are moister than is proportionate and appropriate, others colder, others drier, others hotter, and others entirely well-tempered and in due proportion.\n\nOne must pay the closest attention to this when you examine the temperament of a body. If indeed it is uniformly well-proportioned as a whole, and all the parts preserve their mutual symmetries in length, breadth, and depth, then it could be mixed in the same way throughout—such a type as that. But if a body has a chest and neck and shoulders that are very large, while the loins are thin and small and the legs slender and dry, how could such a body be similarly disposed in all its parts? Nor, if the legs are thick and the loins broad but the chest is narrow, would this be evenly mixed in its parts. Some bodies have a very large head; others a small one, like sparrows. As for the legs, some are knock-kneed, others bow-legged, and at the extremities of the limbs some are thin, others thick. And the chest in some, as was said before, is straight [broad], but in some so narrow as a plank—these they actually call “plank-like.” And whenever the regions about the shoulder blades are entirely without flesh and bare, jutting forward like wings, such natures are called by physicians “winged”; to what a pitch of badness they come—when the chest has all but lost its internal spaciousness, in which the lungs and the heart are set—is evident to everyone.\n\nThere are countless other manifest dispositions of the body’s parts, whenever, deviating from the natural proportion, it falls straightaway, in the very process of being conceived, into some uneven dyscrasia [dyskrasia: bad mixture/imbalance].

For one should not simply conjecture in this way, but it would have been better to first distinguish that among humans, some have bodies with uniform temperament throughout, while others—and not a few of these—have an uneven disposition. For some of their parts are moister than what is proportionate and fitting, others colder, others drier, others warmer, and some are completely well-tempered and proportionate. One must pay special attention to this when examining the temperament of a body. For if it is uniformly well-proportioned as a whole and preserves all the symmetries of the parts in relation to each other in length, width, and depth, such a body might be uniformly tempered throughout. But if a body has a very large chest, neck, and shoulders, but thin and small loins, and slender, dry legs, how could this be similarly disposed in all its parts? Nor indeed, if it has thick legs and broad loins but a narrow chest, would this be uniformly tempered in its parts. Other bodies have an extremely large head, others a small one, like sparrows. And regarding the legs, some are bow-legged, others knock-kneed, and in the extremities of the limbs, some are thin, others thick. And the chest in some, as mentioned before, is straight, but in others so narrow as to be like a board, whom they call \"board-like.\" When their shoulder blades are completely fleshless, bare, and projecting like wings, such natures are called \"wing-like\" by physicians; and how far they reach in deficiency, with the chest having lost almost all its internal space where the lungs and heart are positioned, is obvious to everyone. There are countless other evident conditions of the body's parts when, deviating from natural proportion, it falls into some uneven dyscrasia [abnormal temperament] right from conception. Therefore, in such cases, one should not make inferences about the whole from a single part. For even those who attempt physiognomy do not make simple pronouncements about everything, but these too are taught by experience. For if someone is sufficiently hairy on the chest, they declare him spirited; but if he is such in the thighs, lustful; yet they do not add the cause. For even when they say that the chest resembles a lion's and the thighs a goat's, they have not discovered the primary cause. For reason seeks to discover why the lion is spirited and the goat lustful. Up to this point they have stated what happens but have omitted its cause. But the natural philosopher attempts to discover the causes of these things, just as of all other things. Because lion and goat, and indeed very many other animals, are unevenly disposed in the temperaments of their parts, therefore different ones are readily inclined toward different activities. Aristotle has spoken well about these matters at great length. What is useful for the present discussion is now clear: that one must examine the temperaments of humans by investigating each part individually, and not think that if someone has a hairy chest, his entire body is necessarily warmer and drier, but rather that the heat is greatest in the heart, which is why he is spirited; and sometimes for this very reason their entire body may not be similarly hot and dry, because the heat has been most exhaled there and emptied out to the surrounding environment. For if the temperament of the whole body is uniform, immediately their entire chest would be very broad, their veins wide, their arteries large and pulsing most greatly and vigorously, with much hair throughout the whole body, and the hair of the head most luxuriant, black, and curly in early life, with baldness following as time advances. Moreover, when they have uniform temperament, the whole body of such people will be taut, well-articulated, and muscular, and the skin rather hard and dark, as well as hairy. Similarly, if the opposite conditions occur in the chest while the temperament is uniform throughout the whole body—that is, when all parts become moister and colder—their chest will be narrow and hairless, just as the entire body will be bare of hair, the skin soft and white, with reddish hair, especially in youth, and they do not become bald in old age, and immediately they are cowardly, timid, and sluggish, having small and inconspicuous veins, being fat, weak in sinews and muscles, poorly articulated in their limbs, and bow-legged. However, when the temperament of the parts has been made different, it is no longer possible to make pronouncements about the whole body from one of them, but it is better to go to each one and examine what temperament the stomach has, what the lungs have, what the brain has, and each of the others individually and by itself. These things must be recognized from their functions; for it is not possible to discover their temperament either by touching with touch or by seeing with the eyes. One must also additionally examine the conditions of the parts surrounding them, of all of which the skin is outermost, which in our well-tempered dwelling place indicates the nature of the underlying parts—not simply of all of them, but of those that have the same temperament as the skin. But in regions under the arctic and in the south, since in some the heat has been driven into the depths, being overcome by the external surrounding cold, and in others it has come forward to the skin, being drawn by the surrounding warmth, it is not possible to know clearly about the temperament of the internal parts from the condition of the skin. For the temperament of the body is uneven in intemperate regions, with the external and internal parts not being in the same condition.",

For one should not make such simple conjectures; rather, it would have been better first to make the distinction that while the entire body of some men is uniformly constituted, that of others—and these are not few—is unevenly disposed. For in them, some parts are wetter than is moderate and proper, others are colder, others drier, others hotter, and some are even perfectly well-tempered and proportionate. One must pay the greatest attention to this whenever one examines the constitution of a body. For if a body as a whole is uniformly well-proportioned, preserving all the symmetries of its parts to one another in length, breadth, and depth, such a body could be constituted in the same way throughout. But if a body has a very large chest, neck, and shoulders, but the parts around the loins are gaunt and small, and the legs are thin and dry, how could it be disposed in the same way in all its parts? Nor, indeed, if the legs are thick and the loins broad, but the chest is narrow, could this body be uniformly constituted in its parts. And some bodies have a very large head, while others have a small one, like that of sparrows. And as for their legs, some are knock-kneed, others bow-legged; and as for the ends of their limbs, some are slender, others thick. And the chest, as was said before, is broad in some, but in others so narrow it is like a plank—these men they even call \"plank-chested.\" And when the parts around their shoulder blades are completely fleshless, bare, and jutting out like wings, such natures are called \"wing-like\" by physicians; and it is obvious to everyone to what a degree of badness they have come, since the chest has lost almost all its internal spaciousness, in which the lung and heart are situated. And there are countless other manifest conditions of the body's parts, whenever, in the very process of being conceived, the body deviates from its natural proportion and is altered into some uneven distemperature. Therefore, in such cases, one must not make inferences about the whole from a single part. For not even those who attempt to practice physiognomy make pronouncements about all things in a simple manner, but they too have been taught by experience. For if someone is sufficiently hairy on the chest, they declare him high-spirited; but if he is so on the thighs, they declare him amorous; yet they do not go on to add the cause. For when they say that the chest resembles a lion's, and the parts around the thighs a goat's, they have not discovered the primary cause. For reason seeks to find out why the lion is high-spirited and the goat is amorous. For up to this point they have stated what happens, but have omitted the cause of it. But the natural philosopher, just as with all other things, attempts to discover the causes of these things as well. For it is because not only the lion and the goat, but also a great many other animals, are unevenly disposed with respect to the constitutions of their parts that different ones are suited for different activities. On these matters, Aristotle has spoken well and at great length.\n\nHowever, the point useful for our present purpose is now clear: that one must examine the constitutions of men by scrutinizing each of the parts by itself, and not believe that if someone's chest is hairy, his whole body is necessarily hotter and drier. Rather, the heat is greatest in his heart, which is why he is high-spirited; and it is sometimes possible, for this very reason, that their whole body is not similarly hot and dry, because the greatest amount of air has been breathed in there, and the heat has been evacuated into the surrounding air. For if the constitution of the whole body is uniform, the entire chest of such men would be very broad, their veins wide, and their arteries both large and pulsing with the greatest and most vigorous beat; they would have much hair over their whole body, and the hair on their head would be very fast-growing, black, and curly in their youth, but in the course of time baldness would follow. And indeed, the whole body of such men, when they have a uniform constitution, will be taut, well-articulated, and muscular, and their skin will be harder and darker, as well as hairier. And so too, if the opposite conditions are present in the chest while the constitution is uniform throughout the whole body—that is, if all the parts have become wetter and colder—their chest will be narrow and hairless, and indeed their entire body will be bare of hair, their skin soft and white, and their hair reddish-blond, especially in youth; and they do not become bald when they grow old. And they are at once cowardly, timid, and sluggish, having small and indistinct veins; they are fleshy, weak in their sinews and muscles, with poorly articulated limbs, and they become knock-kneed. If, however, the constitution of the parts has been rendered different, it is no longer possible to make a pronouncement about the entire body from one of them. Rather, it is better to proceed to each part and to examine the constitution of the stomach, the lung, and the brain, and each of the other parts individually and by itself. These things, then, one must discern from their activities; for it is not possible to discover their constitution either by touching them with the hand or by viewing them with the eyes. But one must also examine the conditions of the parts that contain them, of which the skin is the outermost of all. In our own region, which is well-tempered, the skin indicates the nature of the underlying parts—and not of all of them in a simple way, but of as many as have the same constitution as the skin itself. But in the regions under the northern constellations and at the meridian, since in the former the heat has been driven into the depths, overcome by the cold of the surrounding air, while in the latter it has come forth to the skin, drawn out by the heat of the surrounding air, it is not possible to know clearly the constitution of the internal parts from the condition of the skin. For the constitution of the body in intemperate regions is uneven, since the external and internal parts are not in the same state.",

καὶ ξηρὰ καὶ μέλαινα. τὸ δ’ ὅλον σῶμα τῆς μὲν ἐμφύτου θερμότητος ἥκιστα μετέχει, θερμὸν δ’ ἐστὶν ἀλλοτρίῳ τε καὶ ἐπικτήτῳ θερμῷ. καὶ γὰρ δὴ καὶ τοῦτο κάλλιστα πρὸς Ἀριστοτέλους ἐπὶ πολλῶν διώρισται. καὶ χρὴ προσέχειν αὐτῷ τὸν νοῦν, εἴπερ τινὶ καὶ ἄλλῳ, καὶ σκοπεῖσθαι καθ’ ἕκαστον σῶμα, πότερον οἰκείῳ θερμῷ θερμόν ἐστιν, ἢ ἐπικτήτῳ. πάντα γοῦν τὰ σηπόμενα θερμὰ μὲν ἐπικτήτῳ θερμῷ, ψυχρὰ δ’ οἰκείῳ. καὶ τὰ τῶν ἐποικούντων τὴν μεσημβρινὴν χώραν θερμὰ μὲν ἐπικτήτῳ θερμῷ, ψυχρὰ δὲ οἰκείῳ. καὶ παρ’ ἡμῖν δὲ κατὰ μὲν τὸν χειμῶνα τὸ φύσει θερμὸν πλεῖον, τὸ δ’ ἐπίκτητόν ἐστιν ἧττον. ἐν δὲ τῷ θέρει τὸ μὲν ἐπίκτητον πλέον, ἔλαττον δὲ τὸ σύμφυτον. ἅπαντα γοῦν ταῦτα διορίζεσθαι χρὴ τὸν μέλλοντα καλῶς διαγνῶναι κρᾶσιν. οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἁπλῶς, εἰ τὸ δέρμα μελάντερον ἤδη, θερμότερος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὅλος, ἀλλ’ εἰ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων ὡσαύτως ἐχόντων. εἰ γὰρ ὁ μὲν ἐν ἡλίῳ θερμῷ διέτριψεν ἐπιπλέον, ὁ δ’ ἐν σκιᾷ, τῷ μὲν ἔσται μελάντερον τὸ δέρμα, τῷ δὲ λευκότερον. ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν τοῦτο πρὸς τὴν τῆς ὅλης κράσεως ὑπάλλαξιν. αὐτὸ μὲν γὰρ τὸ δέρμα ξηρότερον ἡλιούμενον, ὑγρότερον δ’ ἔσται σκιατραφούμενον. ἡ φυσικὴ δ’ οὐκ εὐθὺς ὑπαλλαχθήσεται κρᾶσις οὔθ’ ἥπατος, οὔτε καρδίας, οὔτε τῶν ἄλλων σπλάγχνων. ἄριστον οὖν, ὡς εἴρηται καὶ πρόσθεν, ἑκάστου τῶν μορίων ἴδια πεπορίσθαι τῆς κράσεως τὰ γνωρίσματα. οἶον τῆς μὲν γαστρὸς, εἰ πέττει καλῶς, εὔκρατος, εἰ δ’ οὐ πέττει καλῶς, δύσκρατος. ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν κνισσώδεις τινὰς ἢ καπνώδεις ἐργάζοιτο τὰς ἐρυγὰς, ἄμετρον αὐτῆς καὶ πυρῶδες ὑπάρχει τὸ θερμόν· εἰ δ’ ὀξείας, ἄῤῥωστόν τε καὶ ἀσθενές. οὕτω δὲ καὶ βόεια κρέα καὶ πάντα τὰ δυσκατέργαστα καλῶς πεπτόντων, ἄμετρον τὸ θερμόν· ἀσθενὲς δὲ τῶν ταῦτα μὲν οὐ πεπτόντων, ἰχθύας δὲ πετραίους ἤ τι τοιοῦτο πεπτόντων. ἐπισκέπτεσθαι δὲ χρὴ πάλιν ἐνταῦθα, εἰ μὴ διά τινα χυμὸν ἑτέρωθεν ἐπιῤῥέοντα τὸ σύμπτωμα γίνεται τῇ γαστρί. φλέγμα μὲν γὰρ ἐνίοις ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς, ξανθὴ δ’ ἄλλοις ἐξ ἥπατος ἐς τὴν γαστέρα καταῤῥεῖ χολὴ, σπάνιον δὲ τοῦτο, καὶ ὀλιγίστοις συμβαίνει. παμπόλλοις δὲ ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς κατέρχεται φλέγμα, καὶ μάλιστα ἐν Ῥώμη τε καὶ τοῖς ὑγροῖς οὕτω χωρίοις. ἀλλά τοι καὶ τὸ σπάνιον ἐπιβλέπειν χρὴ, καὶ μηδὲν ἐν παρέργῳ τίθεσθαι, μηδ’ ἀμελεῖν. οἶδα γὰρ ἐγώ τισιν ἱκανῶς φλεγματώδεσιν ἀνθρώποις ἀθροιζομένην ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ χολὴν παμπόλλην ξανθὴν, ἣν ἐδέοντο πρὸ τῶν σιτίων ὕδωρ πίνοντες ἢ οἶνον ἐξεμεῖν. εἰ δ’ ἥψαντό ποτε σιτίων, πρὶν ἐμέσαι, διέφθειράν τε ταῦτα καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν ὠδυνῶντο, καὶ τούτους ᾤοντό τινες χολώδεις εἷναι φύσει. καίτοι μαλακοί τε ἦσαν ὅλον τὸ σῶμα, καὶ λευκοὶ, καὶ ἄτριχοι, καὶ πιμελώδεις, καὶ ἄφλεβοι, καὶ ἄμυοι, καὶ ἄναιμοι, καὶ ἁπτομένοις οὐ λίαν θερμοί. ἄλλους δέ τινας οἶδα μηδέποτε μὲν ἐμέσαντας χολὴν ξανθὴν, ἰσχνοὺς δὲ καὶ δασεῖς καὶ μυώδεις καὶ μέλανας καὶ φλεβώδεις καὶ θερμοὺς ἱκανῶς, εἴ τις ἅψαιτο, φαινομένους, οἷος καὶ ὁ φιλόσοφος Εὔδημος. ἀλλ’ ἐνταῦθα μὲν ἐμπέπτωκε καὶ ἀνατομικόν τι θεώρημα, ὃ μὴ γνόντες ἔνιοι τῶν ἰατρῶν ἀποροῦνται δεινῶς ἐπὶ τῇ διαφωνίᾳ τῶν συμπτωμάτων, ἀγνοοῦντες, ὡς ὁ πόρος, ᾧ τὴν χολὴν εἰς τὴν γαστέρα τὸ ἧπαρ ἐξερεύγεται, τοῖς μὲν διπλοῦς ἐστι, τοῖς δὲ ἁπλοῦς, ὡς κᾀν ταῖς τῶν τετραπόδων ζώων ἀνατομαῖς ἐστι θεάσασθαι. τὰ πολλὰ μὲν οὖν ἢ ἁπλοῦς ἐστιν, εἰς τὰ μεταξὺ πυλωροῦ τε καὶ νήστεως ἐκφυόμενος, ὃ δὴ γαστρὸς ἔκφυσιν ὀνομάζουσιν, ἢ διπλοῦς γενόμενος εἰς μὲν τὴν ἔκφυσιν ἐμβάλλει θατέρῳ στόματι τῷ μείζονι, θατέρῳ δὲ τῷ μικροτέρῳ κατὰ τὸν πυθμένα, μικρὸν ἀνωτέρω τοῦ πυλωροῦ. σπανιώτατα δὲ τὸ μὲν ἄνω μέρος αὐτοῦ ποτὲ μεῖζον εὑρίσκεται, τὸ κάτω δ’ ἔλαττον. ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ ὧν γε μεῖζόν ἐστιν, ἐπὶ τούτων ἡ γαστὴρ ἐφ’ ἡμέραν ἐμπίπλαται χολῆς οὐκ ὀλίγης, ἣν ἐμεῖν τε δέονται πρὸ τῶν σιτίων, καὶ βλάπτονται κατασχόντες. οἷς δὲ παντελῶς ἁπλοῦς ἐστιν ὁ πόρος, εἰς τὴν νῆστιν ἡ χολὴ τούτοις σύμπασα καταῤῥεῖ. πῶς οὗν χρὴ διαγινώσκειν αὐτούς; οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἀνατεμεῖν γε ζῶντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀξιῶ. πρῶτον μὲν ὅλῃ τοῦ σώματος τῇ κράσει, καθ’ ὅ τι καὶ μικρὸν ἔμπροσθεν ἐλέγετο, δεύτερον δὲ τοῖς ὑπιοῦσι κάτω. χολώδη μὲν γὰρ ἄκρατα διὰ τῆς γαστρὸς ἐξεκενοῦτο συνεχῶς Εὐδήμῳ, διότι καὶ πολλὴν ἤθροιζε χολὴν, καὶ οὐδὲν αὐτῆς εἰς τὴν ἄνω κοιλίαν ἀφικνεῖτο. τοῖς δὲ ἄλλοις, οἷς ἡ μὲν ἕξις φλεγματώδης, ἐμοῦσι δὲ χολὴν, ἥκιστα διαχωρεῖται χολῶδες· καὶ γὰρ ὀλίγον γεννᾶται τῆς ξανθῆς χολῆς αὐτοῖς, καὶ πλεῖστον εἰς τὴν ἄνω κοιλίαν ἀφικνεῖται. τρίτον ἐπὶ τοῖς εἰρημένοις εἶδος γνωρισμάτων ἐν αὐτοῖς τοῖς κενουμένοις ἐστίν. οἷς μὲν γὰρ ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ τὸ χολῶδες γεννᾶται περίττωμα, πρασοειδὲς φαίνεται· ξανθὸν δ’ ἀκριβῶς ἐστιν, ἢ ὠχρόν γε πάντως, οἷς ἐξ ἥπατος ὑπέρχεται. καὶ οἷς μὲν ἐν γαστρὶ τὸ πρασοειδὲς τοῦτο γεννᾶται, χρὴ πάντως αὐτοῖς τὸ ἐδηδεσμένον σιτίον οὐκ ἄρτον οὐδὲ κρέας εἶναι χοίρειον, ἤ τι τοιοῦτο παραπλήσιον, ἀλλὰ θερμότερόν γε, τῶν δ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης, καὶ οὐκ εὔχυμον. οἷς δ’ ἐξ ἥπατος εἰς αὐτὴν ἀφικνεῖται, ξανθὸν ἢ ὠχρὸν ἐμεῖται, κᾂν εὐχυμώτατον ᾖ τὸ ληφθὲν σιτίον, κᾂν ἄκρως πεφθῇ. καὶ μᾶλλον τοῖς ἀκριβῶς πέψασιν ἐμεῖται τὰ ξανθὰ, καὶ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἔτι τοῖς ἐπὶ πλέον αὐτῶν ἀσιτήσασι. τὰ δὲ πρασοειδῆ μόνοις τοῖς κακῶς πέψασιν ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ γεννᾶται. καὶ μὲν δὴ καὶ φροντίδες, καὶ θυμοὶ, καὶ λῦπαι, καὶ πόνοι, καὶ γυμνάσια, καὶ ἀγρυπνίαι, καὶ ἀσιτίαι, καὶ ἔνδειαι πλείονα τὸν τῆς ξανθῆς χολῆς τούτοις ἀθροίζουσι χυμὸν, ὅτι καὶ πλείονα γεννῶσιν ἐν ἥπατι. ταῦτά τε οὖν ἀκριβῆ τὰ γνωρίσματα, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἔτι, τῷ μὲν αὐχμηρῷ καὶ πυρώδει τοῦ κατὰ τὴν γαστέρα θερμοῦ τῆς εἰς τὸ χολῶδες τροπῆς ἑπομένης, ἄρτοι καὶ κρέα χοίρεια καὶ βόεια κάλλιον πεφθήσονται τῶν πετραίων ἰχθύων. εἰ δ’ ἐξ ἥπατος καταῤῥέοι, παρὰ τὴν τῶν ἐδεσμάτων ὑπάλλαξιν οὐδὲ μία τῆς πέψεως ἔσται διαφορά. ἐν τούτοις μὲν δὴ διώρισται τὸ δι’ ἄλλο τι καὶ μὴ διὰ τὴν κρᾶσιν γενόμενον. κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ τρόπον, εἰ κᾀκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἐπὶ τὴν γαστέρα φλέγμα καταῤῥέον ὀξυρεγμίας αἴτιον γίγνοιτο, χρὴ κᾀνταῦθα κατὰ τὰς ὁμοίας μεθόδους ἀποχωρίζειν αὐτὸ τοῦ τῆς γαστρὸς ἰδίου παθήματος. οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὰς τῆς κεφαλῆς ὀδύνας, ἢ διὰ τὴν οἰκείαν αὐτῆς δυσκρασίαν, ἢ διὰ τὰ τῆς γαστρὸς περιττώματα. καὶ μὲν δὴ καὶ τὸν ἐγκέφαλον ἐπισκέπτεσθαι καθ’ ἑαυτὸν, ὁποίας ἐστὶ κράσεως, ἄμεινον, οὖκ ἐκ τῆς τοῦ παντὸς σώματος διαθέσεως. αὐτοῦ δὲ κατ’ αὐτὸν, ὁποίας ἐστὶ κράσεως, ἐπίσκεψις ἥ τε πολίωσίς ἐστιν, οἵ τε κάταῤῥοι, καὶ βῆχες, καὶ κόρυζαι, καὶ σιέλου πλῆθος. ἅπαντα γὰρ ταῦτα ψυχρότερον αὐτὸν ἐμφαίνει καὶ ὑγρότερον ὑπάρχειν. ἔτι δὲ μᾶλλον, εἰ ἐπὶ ταῖς τυχούσαις προφάσεσιν εἰς τοιαύτας ἔρχεται διαθέσεις. ἡ δέ γε φαλάκρωσις ἐπὶ ξηρότητι, καὶ ἡ τῶν μελαινῶν τε καὶ πολλῶν τριχῶν γένεσις εὐκρασίας ἐγκεφάλου γνώρισμα. κατὰ τοῦτον οὖν τὸν τρόπον ἀεὶ χρὴ σκοπεῖσθαι περὶ κράσεως, ἕκαστον ἰδίᾳ μόριον ἐξετάζοντα, καὶ μὴ περὶ πάντων ἀποφαίνεσθαι τολμᾷν ἐξ ἑνὸς, ὥσπερ ἐποίησαν ἔνιοι, τοὺς μὲν σιμοὺς ὑγροὺς εἶναι φάμενοι, τοὺς δὲ γρυποὺς ξηροὺς, καὶ οἶς μὲν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ μικροὶ, ξηροὺς, οἷς δὲ μεγάλοι, ὑγρούς. τοῦτο μὲν οὖν καὶ διαπεφώνηται πρὸς αὐτῶν. οἱ μὲν γάρ τινες ὑποθέμενοι, τῶν ὑγρῶν εἶναι μορίων τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς, ἐν οἷς ἂν μείζους εὑρίσκωσιν, ὑγρότητα κράσεως ἐν τούτοις κρατεῖν ὑπολαμβάνουσιν. ἔνιοι δὲ, τῇ ῥώμῃ τοῦ θερμοῦ κατὰ τὴν πρώτην διάπλασιν ἀναπνεύσαντος ἀθροώτερόν τε καὶ πλεῖον, οὐκ ὀφθαλμοὺς μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ στόμα καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας πόρους γενέσθαι φασὶ μείζονας, ὅθεν οὐχ ὑγρότητος, ἀλλὰ θερμότητος εἶναι γνώρισμα. ἀμφότεροι δὲ διαμαρτάνουσι τῆς ἀληθείας, ἑνὶ μὲν καὶ κοινῷ λόγῳ, διότι περὶ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἐξ ἑνὸς ἀποφαίνεσθαι τολμῶσι μορίου· κατὰ δὲ δεύτερον τρόπον, ὅτι τῆς διαπλαστικῆς ἐν τῇ φύσει δυνάμεως οὐ μέμνηνται, τεχνικῆς οὔσης καὶ τοῖς τῆς ψυχῆς ἤθεσιν ἀκολούθως διαπλαττούσης τὰ μόρια. περὶ ταύτης γάρ τοι καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης ἠπόρησε, μήποτ’ ἄρα θειοτέρας τινὸς ἀρχῆς εἴη, καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὸ θερμὸν καὶ ψυχρὸν, καὶ ξηρὸν καὶ ὑγρόν. οὔκουν ὀρθῶς μοι δοκοῦσι ποιεῖν οἱ προπετῶς οὕτως ὑπὲρ τῶν μεγίστων ἀποφαινόμενοι, καὶ ταῖς ποιότησι μόναις ἀναφέροντες τὴν διάπλασιν. εὔλογον γὰρ, ὄργανα μὲν εἶναι ταύτας, τὸ διαπλάττον δ’ ἕτερον. ἀλλὰ καὶ χωρὶς τῶν τηλικούτων ζητημάτων ἐνδέχεται ἐξευρίσκειν, ὡς ἔμπροσθεν ἐδείξαμεν, ὑγρὰν καὶ ξηρὰν, καὶ θερμὴν καὶ ψυχρὰν κρᾶσιν. ἁμαρτάνουσιν οὖν οἱ τῶν οἰκείων μὲν ἀμελοῦντες γνωρισμάτων, ἐπὶ δὲ τὰ πόῤῥω τε καὶ ζητήσεως ἱκανῆς τετυχηκότα καὶ μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο καὶ παρ’ αὐτοῖς τοῖς ἀρίστοις φιλοσόφοις ἀπορούμενα μεταβαίνοντες. οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδ’ ὅτι τὰ μὲν παιδία σιμώτερα, γρυπώτεροι δ’ οἱ παρακμάζοντες, εὔλογον, ὑγροὺς μὲν νομίζειν τοὺς σιμοὺς ἅπαντας, ξηροὺς δὲ τοὺς γρυπούς. ἀλλ’ ἐνδέχεται μὲν, καὶ τῆς διαπλαστικῆς δυνάμεως ἔργον εἶναι τὸ τοιοῦτο μᾶλλον, ἢ τῆς κράσεως. εἰ δ’ ἄρα καὶ τῆς κράσεως εἴη γνώρισμα, τῆς ἐν τῇ ῥινὶ μόνης εἴη ἄν, οὐ τῆς ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ σώματι. μάτην οὖν ὑπ’ αὐτῶν κᾀκεῖνο λέγεται, τὸ ῥῖνά τε ὀξεῖαν γίνεσθαι καὶ ὀφθαλμοὺς κοίλους καὶ κροτάφους συμπεπτωκότας ἐν ταῖς ξηραῖς φύσει κράσεσιν, ὅτι κᾀν τοῖς πάθεσιν οὕτω συμπίπτει τοῖς συντήκουσί τε καὶ κενοῦσι πέρα τοῦ μετρίου τὰ σώματα. πολλάκις μὲν γὰρ οὕτω συμπίπτει, πολλάκις δ’ οὐχ οὕτως. ἀλλ’ ἔστιν ἰδεῖν καὶ μαλακὴν καὶ πιμελώδη καὶ λευκὴν καὶ πολύσαρκον ὅλου τοῦ σώματος τὴν ἕξιν ἐπὶ μικροῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἢ ὀξείᾳ ῥινὶ, καὶ ξηρὰν καὶ ἄσαρκον καὶ μέλαιναν καὶ δασεῖαν ἐπί τε τοῖς μεγάλοις ὀφθαλμοῖς σιμῇ τε τῇ ῥινί. βέλτιον οὖν, εἴπερ ἄρα τῆς ῥινὸς μόνης, ὑγρότητα μὲν τῇ σιμότητι, ξηρότητα δὲ τῇ γρυπότητι τεκμαίρεσθαι, καὶ μὴ περὶ τῆς ἅπαντος τοῦ ζώου κράσεως ἐντεῦθεν ἀποφαίνεσθαι. κατὰ ταῦτα δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ παντὸς οὗτινος οὖν ἑτέρου μορίου τὴν ἰδίαν κρᾶσιν ἐκ τῶν οἰκείων ἐπισκοπεῖσθαι γνωρισμάτων ἄμεινον, οὐ περὶ τῆς ὅλης τοῦ σώματος κράσεως ἀφ’ ἑνὸς μέρους ἐπίδειξιν λαμβάνειν. εἴτε γὰρ ὑγρότητος, εἴτε θερμότητος ἐπικρατούσης, εἴτε καὶ ἀμφοτέρων, ὀφθαλμοὺς γλαυκοὺς τίθεσθαι χρὴ, γνώρισμα τῆς οἰκείας ἂν εἶεν οὕτω γε, καὶ οὐ τῆς ἁπάντων τῶν μορίων τοῦ σώματος ἐνδεικτικοὶ κράσεως. οὐδὲ γὰρ, εἰ σκληρὰ καὶ ἄσαρκα τὰ σκέλη, ξηρὰ πάντως καὶ ἡ κρᾶσις ὅλου τοῦ σώματος. ἔνιοι γὰρ ἱκανῶς εὔσαρκοι καὶ πιμελώδεις καὶ παχεῖς καὶ προγάστορες καὶ μαλακοὶ καὶ λευκοὶ γίνονται μετὰ τοιούτων σκελῶν. ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν ὁμαλῶς ἅπαν ἔχει τὸ σῶμα τῆς κράσεως, οἶς μὲν ἰσχνὰ τὰ σκέλη, ξηροὶ πάντως εἰσὶν, ὑγροὶ δ’, οἷς παχέα. καὶ οἷς μὲν ἡ ῥὶς ὀξεῖα ἢ γρυπὴ, οὗτοι ξηροὶ, σιμῆς δ’ οὔσης, ὑγροί. κατὰ ταῦτα δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ τῶν κροτάφων, ἁπάντων τε τῶν ἄλλων μορίων. οἷς δ’ ἀνώμαλος ἡ κρᾶσις, καὶ οὐχ ἡ αὐτὴ πάντων τῶν μορίων, ἄτοπόν ἐστιν ἐξ ἑνὸς μορίου φύσεως ὑπὲρ ἁπάντων ἀποφαίνεσθαι. τοιοῦτο δέ τι τοὺς πλείστους αὐτῶν ἠπάτησεν, οὐχ ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων μόνων, ἀλλὰ καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων ζώων ἀποφῄνασθαι τολμήσαντας ὑπὲρ ὅλης τῆς κράσεως ἐκ μόνων τῶν κατὰ τὸ δέρμα γνωρισμάτων. οὐδὲ γὰρ, εἰ σκληρὸν τὸ δέρμα, ξηρὸν ἐξ ἀνάγκης τὸ ζῶον, ἀλλ’ ἐγχωρεῖ τὸ δέρμα μόνον, οὔτ’ εἰ μέλαν, οὔτ’ εἰ δασύ. κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον οὔτ’ εἰ μαλακὸν ἢ ψιλὸν τριχῶν, ὑγρὸν ἐξ ἀνάγκης ὅλον τὸ ζῶον. ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν ὁμαλῶς κέκραται σύμπαν, εὔλογόν ἐστιν, οἷόν περ τὸ δέρμα, τοιοῦτο εἶναι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἕκαστον μορίων· εἰ δ’ ἀνωμάλως, οὐκέτι. τῶν γοῦν ὀστρέων ὑγρότατον μὲν ὅλον τὸ σῶμα, ξηρότατον δὲ τὸ δέρμα. τὸ γὰρ δὴ ὄστρακον αὐτοῖς, οἷόν περ ἡμῖν τὸ δέρμα. καὶ ἡ προσηγορία δ’ ἐντεῦθεν, ὀστρακοδέρμων ἁπάντων τῶν τοιούτων ζώων ὀνομασθέντων, ἐκ τοῦ τὸ δέρμα παραπλήσιον αὐτοῖς εἶναι τῷ ὀστράκῳ. καὶ τὰ μαλακόστρακα δὲ, καθάπερ ἀστακοὶ, καὶ κάραβοι, καὶ καρκῖνοι, ξηρὸν μὲν ἔχει τὸ δέρμα, τὴν δ’ ἄλλην ἅπασαν κρᾶσιν ὑγράν. καὶ αὐτὸ δὴ τοῦτο πολλάκις αἴτιον ὑπάρχει τοῖς ζώοις τῆς ἐν ταῖς σαρξὶν ὑγρότητος, ὅτι πᾶν αὐτοῖς τὸ ξηρὸν καὶ γεῶδες ἡ φύσις ἀποτίθεται πρὸς τὸ δέρμα. μὴ τοίνυν μήθ’, ὅτι ξηρὸν τοῦτο τοῖς ὀστρέοις, εὐθέως καὶ τὴν σάρκα νομιστέον ὑπάρχειν ξηρὰν, μήθ’, ὅτι πλαδαρὰ καὶ μυξώδης, ἤδη τοιοῦτο ὑποληπτέον εἶναι καὶ τὸ δέρμα. δίκαιον γὰρ, ἕκαστον τῶν μορίων ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ γνωρίζεσθαι. ταῦτά τε οὖν ἁμαρτάνουσιν οἱ τὰ περὶ κράσεων ἡμῖν ὑπομνήματα καταλελοιπότες· ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις, ὅτι μηδὲ μέμνηνται τοῦ πρὸς Ἱπποκράτους ὀρθότατα παρῃνημένου, τοῦ δεῖν ἐπισκέπτεσθαι τὰς μεταβολὰς, ἐξ οἵων εἰς οἶα γίγνεται. πολλάκις γὰρ τὰ παρόντα γνωρίσματα τῆς ἔμπροσθεν κράσεώς ἐστιν, οὐ τῆς νῦν ὑπαρχούσης τῷ σώματι. φέρε γὰρ, εἴ τις ἐτῶν γεγονὼς ἑξήκοντα δασὺς ἱκανῶς εἴη, μὴ διότι νῦν ἐστι θερμὸς καὶ ξηρὸς, ἀλλ’ ὅτι πρόσθεν μὲν τοιοῦτος ἐγένετο, ὑπομένουσι δ’ αἱ τότε γεννηθεῖσαι τρίχες, ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ θέρει πολλάκις αἱ κατὰ τὸ ἔαρ ἀναφυεῖσαι βοτάναι. τισὶ μὲν γὰρ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ καὶ κατὰ βραχὺ συνέβη τῆς ἄγαν ἐκείνης ἀπαλλαγῆναι δασύτητος, ἐκπιπτουσῶν ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ξηρότητος τῶν τριχῶν· ἐνίοις δὲ ἄχρι πλείστου παραμένουσιν, οἶς ἂν μήτ’ ἀποξηρανθῶσιν ἱκανῶς ἐπὶ προήκοντι τῷ χρόνῳ, καὶ τὴν πρώτην ἔκφυσιν αἱ τρίχες αὐτοῖς ἰσχυρὰν ποιήσωνται δίκην φυτῶν ἀκριβῶς ἐνεῤῥιζωμένων τῇ γῇ. μὴ τοίνυν, εἰ δασύς τις ἱκανῶς ἐστιν, εὐθὺς τοῦτον οἰώμεθα μελαγχολικὸν ὑπάρχειν, ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν ἀκμάζων, οὔπω τοιοῦτον· εἰ δὲ παρακμάζων, ἤδη μελαγχολικόν· εἰ δὲ γέρων, οὐκ ἔτι. γίνονται γὰρ αἱ μελαγχολικαὶ κράσεις ἐκ συγκαύσεως αἵματος. οὐ μὴν, ἐπειδὰν ἄρξηται τοῦτο πάσχειν, εὐθὺς καὶ κατοπτᾶται τελέως. ἀλλ’ ἐν τάχει μὲν ἱκανῶς ἔσται δασὺς ὁ θερμὸς καὶ ξηρὸς, εἴ γε μεμνήμεθα τῶν ἔμπροσθεν λόγων, οὐκ εὐθέως δὲ μελαγχολικός. ἡ γὰρ τοῦ δέρματος πύκνωσις, εἴργουσα τῶν παχυτέρων περιττωμάτων τὴν διέξοδον, ἀναγκάζει συγκαίεσθαι κατὰ τὰς ἄκρως θερμὰς κράσεις, ὥστε τοιοῦτο αὐτοῖς ὑπάρχειν ἤδη τὸ περίττωμα τὸ φύον τὰς τρίχας, οἷον ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις ἔσεσθαι μέλλει, προελθόντος τοῦ χρόνου. καὶ ταῦτ’ οὖν ἠμέληται τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν, ἔτι τε πρὸς τούτοις, ἐπειδὰν ἐκ τῆς φύσεως τῶν περιττωμάτων ἀδιορίστως περὶ τῶν κράσεων ἀποφαίνωνται. νομίζουσι γὰρ ἀνάλογον ἔχειν τὰς κράσεις τῶν μορίων τῇ φύσει τῶν περιττωμάτων. τὸ δὲ οὐχ ὅλον ἀληθές ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἐγχωρεῖ ποτε περιττώματα μὲν ἀθροίζεσθαι φλεγματώδη, ὑγρὸν δὲ οὐκ εἶναι τὸ μόριον, ἀλλὰ ψυχρὸν μὲν ἐξ ἀνάγκης, ὑγρὸν δ’ οὐκ ἐξ ἀνάγκης· ἐγχωρεῖ γὰρ καὶ ξηρὸν εἶναι. τὸ δ’ ἀπατῆσαν αὐτοὺς εὐφώρατον. οὐ γὰρ ἐνόησαν, ὡς ἐκ τῶν σιτίων, καὶ οὐκ ἐξ αὐτοῦ τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν γίγνεται τὸ φλέγμα. θαυμαστὸν οὖν οὐδὲν, εἰ μὴ κρατῆσάν ποτε τὸ σῶμα τῶν προσενεχθέντων σιτίων, ὑγρῶν, εἰ τύχοι, τὴν φύσιν ὑπαρχόντων, ὅμοιον αὐτοῖς ἀποτελέσει καὶ τὸ περίττωμα. μὴ τοίνυν ὑπολαμβανέτωσαν, ὥσπερ τὸ σῶμα ξηρὸν, οὕτω καὶ τὸ περίττωμα δεῖν ξηρὸν εἶναι. εἰ γάρ τις εὐθὺς ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐγένετο τῇ

      "openai_translation": "Among Ethiopians and Arabs and all those who live toward the south, the nature of the skin, as might be expected both from the surrounding heat and from the native warmth being driven outward, is seared, hard, dry, and dark. But the body as a whole partakes least of the innate heat; it is warm from an external and acquired heat. Indeed this point has been most carefully distinguished by Aristotle in many places, and one ought to attend to him, if to anyone, and to examine in the case of each body whether it is warm by its own proper [oikeios] heat or by an acquired [epiktētos] heat. For all things that are putrefying are warm by an acquired heat but cold in their own; and the peoples inhabiting the southern region are warm by an acquired heat but cold in their own. Among us too, in winter the natural heat is greater and the acquired less, whereas in summer the acquired is greater and the innate less. All these points, then, must be distinguished by anyone who intends to determine temperament [krâsis, “mixture/temperament”] correctly. For it is not simply the case that, if the skin is already darker, the whole person is warmer—unless all other things are likewise the same. If one person has spent more time in hot sun and another in shade, the skin of the former will be darker and that of the latter whiter; but this contributes nothing to a change in the temperament of the whole. The skin itself becomes drier by sunning and moister by being reared in shade; but the natural temperament of the liver, heart, and the other viscera will not straightway be altered.\n\nIt is best, therefore—as said earlier as well—to have determined the proper diagnostic signs of the temperament of each of the parts. For example, as to the stomach: if it digests well, it is well-tempered; if it does not digest well, it is ill-tempered. And if it produces eructations that are acrid with a scorched or smoky character, the heat in it is excessive and fiery; but if they are sharp [acidic], it is both unhealthy and weak. Likewise, if one digests well even beef and all the hard-to-work meats, the heat is immoderate; but if one does not digest such things yet digests rock-fish or the like, the heat is weak. One must then also examine in this case whether the symptom arises in the stomach from some humor flowing in from elsewhere. For in some, phlegm flows down from the head; in others, yellow bile from the liver flows into the stomach—this is rare and happens to very few—whereas in very many, phlegm descends from the head, especially at Rome and in similarly moist places. Yet the rare, too, must be kept in view, and nothing set aside as a side-issue or neglected. For I know men sufficiently phlegmatic in whom there was amassed in the stomach a great quantity of yellow bile, which they had to vomit up before food by drinking water or wine. And if they ever touched food before vomiting, they both ruined that food and suffered headache, and some thought these men were bilious by nature. Yet they were soft in the whole body, and white, and scant of hair, and fatty, and without veins, and without muscle, and without blood, and not very warm to the touch. I also know others who never vomited yellow bile, yet were lean and hairy and muscular and dark and veiny and fairly warm to the touch—such a one was the philosopher Eudemus.\n\nBut here an anatomical observation comes in, the ignorance of which leads some physicians into great perplexity at the discrepancy of the symptoms: they do not know that the channel by which the liver discharges bile into the stomach is in some double and in others single, as can also be seen in the dissections of quadrupeds. In most cases, either it is single, opening into the outgrowth between the pylorus and the fundus (what they call the “outgrowth” of the stomach), or being double, it empties by the larger mouth into the outgrowth and by the smaller into the bottom a little above the pylorus. Very rarely is the upper part of it found larger and the lower smaller; but in those whose upper part is larger, the stomach is filled day by day with no small amount of bile, which they both need to vomit up before food, and are harmed if they retain it. In those whose channel is entirely single, all the bile flows into the duodenum [nēstis, “fasting-gut,” i.e., the first part of the intestine].\n\nHow then should one diagnose them? For I do not propose to dissect human beings while alive. First, by the temperament of the whole body, as was said a little earlier; second, by what passes downwards. In Eudemus, undiluted bilious stools were voided continuously, because he both produced much bile and none of it reached the upper belly [the stomach]. But in others whose constitution is phlegmatic, though they vomit bile, what is bilious is least separated out; for they generate little yellow bile, and most of it reaches the upper belly. A third class of signs, in addition to these, is in the excreta themselves. For in those in whom the bilious residue is produced in the stomach, it appears leek-green [prasoeides]; but it is precisely yellow, or at any rate pale, in those to whom it comes from the liver. And in those in whom this leek-green matter is produced in the stomach, the food taken must by all means not be bread or pork or anything of that sort, but rather something warmer and, of necessity, not rich in good juice. But those in whom it comes into the stomach from the liver will vomit yellow or pale matter even if the food taken is most nourishing and perfectly cooked; indeed the more thoroughly they have digested, and much more still if they have fasted longer, the more they will vomit yellows. The leek-green forms only in those who have digested badly in the stomach. Moreover, anxieties, angers, griefs, labors, exercises, sleeplessness, fasting, and privations accumulate a greater amount of the humor of yellow bile in these persons, because they also generate more of it in the liver. These are exact signs; and besides them, when the heat about the stomach is parched and fiery, with the turn toward the bilious, breads and pork and beef will be cooked better than rock-fish; but if it flows down from the liver, not even a single difference in digestion will result from changing the foods.\n\nSo much, then, for distinguishing what arises from some other source and not from the temperament. In the same way, if phlegm flowing down from the head to the stomach becomes the cause of sharp belchings, here too one must, by similar methods, separate it from a disorder belonging properly to the stomach. And likewise headaches come either from the head’s own bad temperament or from the residues of the stomach. Indeed it is better to examine the brain by itself to learn what temperament it has, rather than from the condition of the whole body. Examination of the brain’s own temperament is supplied by graying, catarrhs [karrhous], coughs, coryzas [koryzai, nasal discharges], and abundance of saliva; all these show that it is relatively colder and wetter. And even more so if, on the slightest occasions, it tends toward such states. Baldness is due to dryness, and the growth of hair that is both black and abundant is a sign of a well-tempered brain.\n\nIn this way, then, one must always inquire about temperament, examining each part separately, and not presume to pronounce about everything from one thing alone, as some have done—saying that snub-nosed people are moist, hooked-nosed dry, and those with small eyes dry, those with large eyes moist. On this point they even contradict one another. Some, assuming that the eyes belong among moist parts, whenever they find larger eyes infer that moist temperament prevails in those people; others say that, when at the first formation the warmth exhaled more powerfully and in greater quantity, not only the eyes but also the mouth and all the other pores became larger, whence they take largeness to be a mark not of moisture but of heat. Both parties miss the truth, first because they dare to pronounce about the whole body from a single part; second, because they do not remember the formative power in nature, which is art-like and fashions the parts in accordance with the habits of the soul. Aristotle too, for his part, was puzzled whether perhaps there is some more divine principle, and not merely hot/cold and dry/moist. Therefore, those who rashly make pronouncements in this way about the greatest matters, and refer formation solely to qualities, do not seem to me",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 6.3:**\n\nFor Ethiopians, Arabs, and all those dwelling in southern regions, the nature of their skin, being burnt by both the surrounding heat and the innate warmth being drawn outward, is hard, dry, and black. Their whole body partakes least of innate heat, but is hot with an alien and acquired heat. For this too has been excellently distinguished by Aristotle in many cases. And one must pay attention to this, if to anything else, and examine in each body whether it is hot with its own heat or with acquired heat. For all putrefying things are hot with acquired heat but cold in their own nature. And the bodies of those inhabiting southern regions are hot with acquired heat but cold in their own nature. Among us too, in winter there is more natural heat but less acquired heat. In summer there is more acquired heat but less innate heat. All these things must be distinguished by one who intends to properly diagnose temperament. For it is not simply the case that if the skin is darker, the whole person is hotter, but only if all other things are equal. For if one has spent more time in the hot sun while another has been in shade, the former will have darker skin, the latter whiter. But this has nothing to do with change in overall temperament. For the skin itself becomes drier when exposed to sun, moister when kept in shade. But the natural temperament of neither liver, heart, nor other organs is immediately altered. Therefore it is best, as was said before, to obtain specific indicators of temperament for each part. For instance, if the stomach digests well, it is well-tempered; if it does not digest well, it is ill-tempered. But if it produces fatty or smoky belches, its heat is excessive and fiery; if acid ones, it is weak and feeble. Thus when beef and all hard-to-digest foods are well digested, the heat is excessive; but weak in those who cannot digest these but can digest rock fish or something similar. But here again one must examine whether the symptom occurs in the stomach due to some humor flowing from elsewhere. For in some, phlegm flows down from the head, in others yellow bile from the liver into the stomach - though this is rare and happens to very few. But in very many, phlegm descends from the head, especially in Rome and such moist regions. But one must also observe the rare cases and not treat anything as secondary or neglect it. For I know some quite phlegmatic people in whom much yellow bile accumulates in the stomach, which they need to vomit by drinking water or wine before meals. If they ever touch food before vomiting, they corrupt it, get headaches, and some think these people are bilious by nature. Yet they were soft throughout the body, white, hairless, fatty, veinless, without muscle, bloodless, and not very hot to touch. I know others who never vomited yellow bile but were lean, hairy, muscular, dark, veiny, and quite hot to touch, like the philosopher Eudemus. But here an anatomical observation comes in, which some physicians not knowing are terribly perplexed by the contradiction of symptoms, not knowing that the duct through which the liver discharges bile into the stomach is double in some, single in others, as can be seen in dissections of quadrupeds. Most often it is either single, opening between the pylorus and jejunum (which they call the stomach's outlet), or becoming double, it empties with one larger opening into the outlet, with the other smaller one at the fundus, a little above the pylorus. Very rarely the upper part is sometimes found larger, the lower smaller. But in those where it is larger, the stomach fills daily with no small amount of bile, which they need to vomit before meals and are harmed if they retain it. In those where the duct is completely single, all the bile flows down into the jejunum. How then should one diagnose them? For I do not propose to dissect living people. First by the whole temperament of the body, as was just said a little before; second by what passes below. For Eudemus continuously evacuated pure bilious matter through the stomach because he accumulated much bile and none of it reached the upper cavity. But for others whose constitution is phlegmatic but who vomit bile, very little bilious matter passes in their stools; for little yellow bile is generated in them, and most reaches the upper cavity. A third type of indicator beyond those mentioned is in the evacuations themselves. For in those where the bilious waste is generated in the stomach, it appears leek-green; but it is precisely yellow or at least pale in those where it comes from the liver. And in those where this leek-green matter is generated in the stomach, the food eaten must not be bread or pork or anything similar, but something hotter and necessarily not of good humor. In those where it comes from the liver to the stomach, yellow or pale matter is vomited even if the food taken was of excellent humor and perfectly digested. And the yellow matter is vomited more by those who have digested perfectly, and much more by those who have fasted longer. The leek-green matter is generated only in those who have digested poorly in the stomach. Moreover, worries, anger, grief, toils, exercises, sleeplessness, fasting, and deficiencies accumulate more yellow bile humor in these people because they generate more in the liver. These then are precise indicators, and beyond these, when the heat in the stomach is parched and fiery with a tendency toward the bilious, bread and pork and beef will be better digested than rock fish. But if it flows down from the liver, there will be no difference in digestion according to the variation of foods. In these cases what occurs due to something else and not due to temperament has been distinguished. In the same way, if phlegm flowing from the head to the stomach causes acid belching, one must here too by similar methods separate this from the stomach's own condition. Similarly with headaches, whether due to its own dyscrasia or due to the stomach's waste products. And indeed it is better to examine the brain itself for what kind of temperament it has, not from the condition of the whole body. The examination of what temperament it has by itself includes graying hair, catarrhs, coughs, coryza, and abundance of saliva. For all these indicate it is colder and moister. Even more so if it comes to such conditions from chance causes. Baldness indicates dryness, and the generation of black and abundant hair is a sign of good brain temperament. In this way then one must always examine temperament, investigating each part individually, and not dare to make pronouncements about all from one, as some have done, saying the snub-nosed are moist, the hook-nosed dry, and those with small eyes dry, those with large eyes moist. This indeed has been disputed among them. For some, assuming the eyes are moist parts, suppose that in those where they are found larger, moisture of temperament prevails. But some say that by the force of heat in the first formation breathing out more abundantly and more, not only eyes but also mouth and all other passages become larger, hence it is a sign not of moisture but of heat. Both err from the truth, first by a common argument, because they dare to pronounce about the whole body from one part; secondly, because they do not remember the formative power in nature, which is artistic and shapes the parts in accordance with the soul's character. For Aristotle indeed was puzzled about this, whether it might be of some more divine origin and not according to hot and cold, dry and moist. Therefore those who thus rashly pronounce about the greatest matters and refer formation to qualities alone do not seem to me to act correctly. For it is reasonable that these are instruments, but what forms is something else. But even apart from such great inquiries, it is possible to discover, as we showed before, moist and dry, hot and cold temperament. Therefore those err who neglect proper indicators and turn to things that are remote and have received sufficient inquiry and are still puzzled about even by the best philosophers. For it is not reasonable to think all snub-nosed people moist and all hook-nosed dry, just because children are more snub-nosed and those past their prime more hook-nosed. But it is possible that this is more the work of the formative power than of temperament. And if it were indeed a sign of temperament, it would be only of that in the nose, not in the whole body. Therefore what they say is also in vain, that the nose becomes sharp and eyes hollow and temples sunken in naturally dry temperaments, because this also happens in diseases that waste and excessively empty bodies. For often it happens thus, often not. But one can see a soft, fatty, white, fleshy constitution of the whole body with small eyes or sharp nose, and a dry, fleshless, dark, hairy one with large eyes and snub nose. Therefore it is better",

      "gemini_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 6.3:**\n\nIn Ethiopians, Arabs, and all those who live in the south, the nature of the skin—as though scorched by both the surrounding warmth and by the innate heat being carried outwards—is burnt, hard, dry, and black. The body as a whole, however, partakes very little of innate heat, but is hot with a foreign and acquired heat. For indeed, this very point has been most excellently established by Aristotle in many instances. And one must pay close attention to this, if to anything, and examine in the case of each body whether it is hot with its own proper heat or with acquired heat. All things that putrefy, for instance, are hot with an acquired heat, but cold with respect to their own proper heat. Likewise, the bodies of those who inhabit the southern region are hot with an acquired heat, but cold with respect to their own proper heat. And among us as well, in winter the natural heat is greater while the acquired is less; whereas in summer the acquired heat is greater, while the innate heat is less. Therefore, one who intends to correctly diagnose a temperament [krasis] must distinguish all these things. For it is not the case that, simply because the skin is blacker, the person as a whole is hotter; rather, this is so only if all other factors are equal. For if one person has spent more time in the hot sun and another in the shade, the former’s skin will be blacker and the latter’s whiter. But this has no bearing on the alteration of the overall temperament. The skin itself, when sunned, becomes drier, and when raised in the shade, it will be moister. But the natural temperament of the liver, the heart, or the other viscera will not be immediately altered.\n\nIt is best, therefore, as was said before, to have procured for each of the parts its own particular signs of temperament. For example, regarding the stomach: if it digests well, it is well-tempered [eukratos]; if it does not digest well, it is ill-tempered [dyskratos]. But if it produces belches that smell of burnt fat or smoke, its heat is excessive and fiery; if the belches are acidic, its heat is sickly and weak. Likewise, if it digests beef and all other hard-to-process foods well, its heat is excessive; but its heat is weak if it fails to digest these things, while digesting rockfish or something of that sort. Here again, however, one must investigate whether the symptom in the stomach is not caused by some humor flowing into it from another source. For in some people, phlegm flows down from the head, while in others, yellow bile flows from the liver into the stomach; this latter is rare and happens to very few. But in a great many people, phlegm descends from the head, especially in Rome and other such damp places. Yet one must also observe the rare case, and consider nothing a side-issue or neglect it. For I know of some quite phlegmatic people in whom a great deal of yellow bile would collect in the stomach, which they needed to vomit up by drinking water or wine before meals. If ever they touched food before vomiting, they would spoil it and suffer headaches, and some thought these people were bilious by nature. And yet their whole body was soft, white, hairless, plump, veinless, lacking in muscle, and bloodless, and not very hot to the touch. And I know of certain others who never vomited yellow bile, but who appeared lean, hairy, muscular, dark, and veiny, and quite hot if one touched them—such as the philosopher Eudemus.\n\nBut here an anatomical observation has intruded, which some physicians, not knowing it, are terribly perplexed by the discrepancy of the symptoms, being ignorant that the duct [poros] by which the liver discharges bile into the stomach is double in some people and single in others, as can also be seen in the anatomies of four-footed animals. In most cases, the duct is either single, growing out into the region between the pylorus and the jejunum (which they call the \"outgrowth of the stomach\" [likely the duodenum]), or it is double, with its larger opening emptying into the \"outgrowth\" and its smaller one into the base of the stomach, a little above the pylorus. Very rarely, its upper part is sometimes found to be larger and the lower part smaller. But in those in whom it is larger, the stomach is filled daily with a considerable amount of bile, which they need to vomit before meals and are harmed if they retain it. But in those in whom the duct is entirely single, all the bile flows down into the jejunum. How then should one distinguish between them? For I certainly do not think it right to dissect living human beings. First, by the temperament of the whole body, as was said a little earlier; second, by what passes downwards. For Eudemus constantly evacuated unmixed bilious matter through his bowels, because he both collected a great deal of bile and none of it reached his upper belly [i.e., the stomach]. But in the others, whose constitution [hexis] is phlegmatic but who vomit bile, very little bilious matter is passed in the stool; for little yellow bile is produced in them, and most of it reaches the upper belly. A third kind of sign, in addition to those mentioned, is found in the evacuated matter itself. In those in whom the bilious residue is generated in the stomach, it appears leek-green; but it is precisely yellow, or at any rate pale, in those in whom it comes down from the liver. And in those in whom this leek-green matter is generated in the stomach, the food they have eaten must not be bread or pork or anything similar, but something hotter and, of necessity, not of good humor. But those in whom it comes from the liver will vomit yellow or pale matter, even if the food taken was of the best humor and even if it was perfectly digested. And the yellow matter is vomited more by those who have digested perfectly, and much more still by those who have fasted from such foods for a longer time. The leek-green matter, however, is generated in the belly only of those who have digested poorly. Furthermore, worries, anger, grief, toils, exercises, sleeplessness, fasting, and deprivations collect a greater amount of the humor of yellow bile in these people, because they also generate more of it in the liver. These, then, are accurate signs, and in addition to them, when the change to a bilious state follows from a parched and fiery quality of the heat in the stomach, bread and pork and beef will be better digested than rockfish. But if the bile flows down from the liver, there will be no difference in digestion corresponding to the change in foods. By these means, then, a condition arising from some other cause and not from the temperament has been defined.\n\nIn the same way, if phlegm flowing down from the head to the stomach should become the cause of acid indigestion, here too one must, by similar methods, separate it from a disorder proper to the stomach itself. And so too with headaches, whether they arise from the head's own distemper [dyskrasia] or from residues in the stomach. Indeed, it is better to investigate the brain by itself to see what sort of temperament it has, not from the disposition of the whole body. The investigation of its own particular temperament involves graying of the hair, catarrhs, coughs, colds, and an abundance of saliva. For all these things indicate that it is colder and moister. And this is even more so if it falls into such dispositions on the slightest pretexts. Baldness, on the other hand, is associated with dryness, and the growth of dark and abundant hair is a sign of a well-tempered brain. In this way, therefore, one must always investigate temperament, examining each part individually, and not daring to make pronouncements about all of them based on one, as some have done, saying that snub-nosed people are moist and hook-nosed people are dry, and that those with small eyes are dry, while those with large eyes are moist. This very point, in fact, is disputed among them. For some, postulating that the eyes are among the moist parts, suppose that in whomever they find them to be larger, a moistness of temperament prevails. But others claim that, because the power of heat during the initial formation expanded more suddenly and in greater quantity, not only the eyes but also the mouth and all the other orifices became larger; whence they say this is a sign not of moistness, but of heat. But both are mistaken, for one common reason: because they dare to make pronouncements about the whole body from a single part. And for a second reason: because they do not take into account the formative faculty [dynamis] in nature, which is artful and shapes the parts in accordance with the characteristics of the soul. Indeed, Aristotle himself was perplexed about this, wondering whether it might not be of some more divine principle, and not according to the hot and cold, and dry and moist. Therefore, they do not seem to me to act correctly who so rashly make pronouncements on the most important matters, attributing formation to the qualities alone. For it is reasonable that these are the instruments, but that which does the forming is something else. But even apart from such great questions, it is possible to discover, as we showed before, a moist and dry, and a hot and cold temperament. They err, therefore, who neglect the proper signs and turn instead to things that are remote and have been the subject of sufficient inquiry right up to the present day and are still debated even by the best philosophers.\n\nFor it is not reasonable, just because children are more snub-nosed and those past their prime more hook-nosed, to consider all snub-nosed people moist and all hook-nosed people dry. It is possible that such a feature is more the work of the formative faculty than of the temperament. But if it should be a sign of temperament, it would be of that in the nose alone, not of that in the whole body. In vain, therefore, is that other point made by them: that the nose becomes sharp and the eyes sunken and the temples collapsed in naturally dry temperaments, because this is also what happens in afflictions that waste away and empty the body beyond due measure. For often it does happen this way, but often it does not. It is possible to see a soft, plump, white, and very fleshy constitution of the whole body in combination with small eyes or a sharp nose, and a dry, fleshless, dark, and hairy constitution with large eyes and a snub nose. It is better, therefore, if it is a matter of the nose alone, to infer moistness from a snub shape and dryness from a hooked shape, and not to make pronouncements about the temperament of the entire animal from this. In the same way, concerning the eyes and every other part whatsoever, it is better to investigate its individual temperament from its own proper signs, not to take a demonstration of the whole body's temperament from a single part. For whether we are to posit that gray-blue eyes are caused by a predominance of moistness, or of heat, or of both, they would in this way be a sign of their own proper temperament, and not indicative of the temperament of all the parts of the body. Nor, if the legs are hard and fleshless, is the temperament of the whole body necessarily dry. For some people become quite fleshy, plump, thick, pot-bellied, soft, and white while having such legs. But if the whole body has a uniform temperament, then those with lean legs are certainly dry, and those with thick legs are moist. And those whose nose is sharp or hooked are dry, but if it is snub, they are moist. And the same applies to the eyes, the temples, and all the other parts. But in those whose temperament is non-uniform, and not the same in all parts, it is absurd to make pronouncements about all of them from the nature of a single part.\n\nSomething of this sort has deceived most of them, who have dared to make pronouncements not only about humans but also about other animals concerning the entire temperament based solely on the signs of the skin. For it is not the case that if the skin is hard, the animal is necessarily dry; it is possible for the skin alone to be so. Nor if it is black, nor if it is hairy. And in the same way, not if it is soft or bare of hair is the whole animal necessarily moist. But if the whole is uniformly tempered, it is reasonable that each of the other parts is of the same sort as the skin; but if it is non-uniformly tempered, this is no longer so. In shellfish, for instance, the whole body is very moist, but the skin is very dry. For their shell is to them what the skin is to us. And their name comes from this, as all such animals are called \"ostracoderms\" [shell-skinned], from their skin being similar to a shell [ostrakon]. And the crustaceans [malakostraka], such as lobsters, crayfish, and crabs, have a dry skin, but their entire remaining temperament is moist. And this very thing is often the cause of the moistness in the flesh of animals: that nature deposits all their dry and earthy substance into the skin. Therefore, let us not think, just because the skin of shellfish is dry, that their flesh is immediately dry too; nor, because the flesh is flabby and slimy, should we at once suppose their skin to be so. For it is just that each of the parts be known from itself.\n\nThese, then, are the errors made by those who have left us memoirs on temperaments. And in addition to these, they err in that they make no mention of the most correct advice given by Hippocrates: that one must observe the changes, from what states they pass into what other states. For often the present signs belong to the former temperament, not to the one now belonging to the body. For instance, suppose someone who has reached the age of sixty is quite hairy; this is not because he is now hot and dry, but because he was so before, and the hairs generated then remain, just as often in summer the herbs that sprouted in the spring remain. In some people, over time and little by little, it has happened that they are rid of that excessive hairiness, as the hairs fall out from extreme dryness; but in others they remain for a very long time, in whom they have not become sufficiently dried out over the advanced period of time, and whose hairs made a strong initial growth, like plants firmly rooted in the earth. Therefore, if someone is quite hairy, let us not immediately think him to be melancholic. If he is in his prime, he is not yet so; if he is past his prime, he is already melancholic; but if he is an old man, he is no longer so. For melancholic temperaments arise from the scorching of the blood. However, when this process begins, it is not immediately perfected. A hot and dry person will become quite hairy quickly enough, if we recall our earlier arguments, but not immediately melancholic. For the denseness of the skin, by blocking the exit of the thicker residues, forces them to be scorched in extremely hot temperaments, so that the residue that grows the hairs is already of the sort that will be in the vessels as time goes on. These points too have been neglected by our predecessors, and furthermore, they err when they make undifferentiated pronouncements about temperaments based on the nature of the residues. For they believe that the temperaments of the parts are analogous to the nature of the residues. But this is not entirely true; it is possible for phlegmatic residues to collect, while the part is not moist, but necessarily cold, though not necessarily moist; for it can also be dry. The thing that deceived them is easy to spot. For they did not understand that phlegm is produced from our foods, and not from our body itself. It is no wonder, then, if the body, failing at some time to master the foods consumed—which happen to be moist in nature—produces a residue similar to them. Therefore, let them not suppose that just as the body is dry, so too must the residue be dry. For if someone was from the very beginning drier and colder in his temperament, such a person is not melancholic, but phlegmatic in his residues. But if he became dry and cold through a change of state, such a person is of necessity already melancholic; for example, if someone who was previously hot and dry generated a great deal of black bile from the scorching of his blood. This, at any rate, is the person who, in addition to being dry and cold, is also immediately melancholic. But if someone were cold and dry from the beginning, this person's bodily constitution is white, soft, and hairless, veinless, without prominent joints, lean, and cold to the touch, and his soul's character is timid, cowardly, and despondent, but his residues are not melancholic.\n\nIn all these matters, then, the majority of physicians err by departing from the proper signs and turning to things that are incidental, occurring not always but only for the most part. For this reason, they also believe that what heats, necessarily dries. Having added this point, as a kind of crown and conclusion to this whole discourse, I have decided to end this second book now. For instance, when they repeatedly pour hot water on inflamed parts and then see their moisture being evacuated, they think it is clearly shown that drying is in every way caused by heating, not only if it is combined with dryness, but even if it is with moistness. But it is not the same thing to evacuate a moisture that is dispersed in certain spaces and to render the proper temperament of a part drier. For in inflamed parts an uneven distemper arises, in which the homoiomerous bodies [i.e., uniform tissues] have not yet departed from their own nature, but are still undergoing change and alteration, while all the spaces in between are filled with the flux. Therefore, all things that are hot and moist in their temperament, when applied to parts in this condition, evacuate that excess fluid which has occupied the spaces between the homoiomerous parts; but as for the bodies themselves, they are so far from drying them that they even impart moisture to them. The truth, then, is thus. But what has been said requires proof, which, believing it to be too long to be added to the present discourse, and moreover requiring an audience knowledgeable about the power of drugs, I shall postpone discussing for now. But when I have gone through this entire third discourse on temperaments, and have demonstrated the whole method concerning things that are potentially moist, cold, hot, and dry, I have decided to write next another whole book on the uneven distemper. For our entire account of temperaments will thus be completed, and it will provide no small starting-points for the therapeutic method.",

      "openai_translation": "That each of the things that are actually hot and cold and dry and moist is so either because it has received an extreme quality, or by the predominance of one of these [qualities], or by comparison with a homogeneous standard that is proportionate, or by comparison with any chance thing whatsoever, has been stated above. It has also been shown how one might most accurately recognize them. What remains is to go on to those that are such in potentiality, after first explaining the word itself—what “potentially” means. And the explanation is brief and easy and clear. For whatever is not yet such as it is said to be, but is by nature disposed to become so, we say that it exists potentially: thus “rational” of a newborn human being, “winged” of a bird, “hunting” of a dog, “swift” of a horse—each of which is altogether going to be such unless something external prevents it; we speak of it as being so already in this sense. From this, I think, we also say that all these exist potentially, not actually. For actuality is something perfect and already present; whereas the potential is in a way imperfect and still future, and, as it were, apt for coming to be what is spoken of, but not yet existent. For the infant is not yet rational, but is about to be; nor is the just-born puppy already a hunter, since it does not yet see; but because it will be able to hunt once perfected, we call it by that name.\n\nMost properly, then, we call those things alone “potentially” such in which nature itself reaches toward completion, provided that nothing external hinders it. And next we include as potential all the proximate matters [“proximate matter” = the material immediately capable of becoming a given form] of things that come to be. It makes no difference whether one says “proximate,” or “proper,” or “peculiar”; in all of these the notion of what is “near” is indicated—that is, without some other change intervening in between. For example, if you call blood “potentially flesh,” in that it needs only the least change to become flesh. But the food that has been digested in the belly is not proximate matter for flesh, but only through the intermediate stage of blood; and even more remote is dough, and bread is further still. For three changes are required for the generation of flesh. Yet all these too are said to be flesh potentially. And prior to these, fire and air and water and earth, and the common matter of these themselves, are so called. All these are spoken of by way of extension, some more, some less. But the first mode is the most proper of those in which things are said to exist as this or that potentially. Next comes that which is according to the proper matter—for example, if you say that sooty vapor is potentially flame, or steam is potentially air.\n\nSometimes “potentially” is also set over against “per accidens” [kata sumbebekos], as when someone says that a cold bath heats the body of a well-fleshed youth—“per accidens,” then, by its proper potentiality. In so many ways, then, will cold and dry and moist and hot things be spoken of and inquired into as being such potentially, and it will be asked fittingly why we call castoreum, or euphorbium, or pyrethrum, or struthion, or nitron, or misy hot, and why lettuce, or hemlock, or mandrake, or salamander, or poppy are called cold—whether they fall under the ways just mentioned, or are so called in some other way not yet explained.\n\nAsphalt and resin and suet, and oil and pitch, are potentially hot because they readily become hot in actuality: they flare up quickest, and when applied to our bodies they manifestly heat them. But chalcitis and misy and napy and nitron, and acoron and maion, and costus, and pyrethrum seem hot when applied to us—some more, some less—yet they are not naturally apt to burst into flame. Are those who examine only whether they ignite readily self-deceived, then? The examination should rather be whether they do not become live coals; for charcoal is no less fire than flame. Flame arises from air, or some airy body, being ignited; live coal from earth, or some earthy thing.\n\nUp to this point, then, the account seems entirely self-consistent: for those drugs which, when touched by fire, are quickly set ablaze, are the same ones that heat us—except when, because of their grossness, they are not readily admitted within the body. A more exact distinction on these matters will be given further on in the work On the Powers of Drugs. At any rate, whatever appears to heat our body is also readily enkindled. “How is it, then,” they say, “that when we touch them they do not feel hot?” I do not know why they say this. For if we were asserting that each of the things mentioned is hot already and actually, it would indeed be surprising how they do not feel hot to the touch. But as things stand, since we call such things “potentially” hot on the ground that they are able to become hot readily, nothing is surprising if they do not yet heat those who touch them. For fire itself does not increase until the wood is overcome by it and undergoes change—and this always takes some time; in the same way, the heat within living beings likewise does not [increase] unless the drugs are first changed by it. For the person warmed by a fire or in the sun is heated in one way, and the person heated by each of the drugs mentioned is heated in another. The former are hot actually; none of the drugs is so. Therefore, they cannot heat us until they become such in actuality; and they receive actuality from ourselves, just as dry reeds do from fire. Thus all wood is cold according to its own nature; but the drier and smaller sorts are quickly converted into fire, whereas the wetter and larger require more time. So there is nothing surprising if drugs likewise must first be broken down into small and fine parts, and second must spend some time—even the shortest—in contact with our bodies, before becoming hot. But if, without first pulverizing them or warming them, you demand that they already be hot, you seem to me to have forgotten what “potentially hot” means; you are testing them as though they were hot in actuality. Nor is it any wonder if they must first be heated in order to heat in return. This, in fact, occurs in the case of wood as well: for the flame that is on the point of going out is both preserved and increased when the wood is first",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation:**\n\nThat we say each thing that is actually hot, cold, dry, or moist is such either by having received the extreme quality, or by the predominance of one of these, or by comparing it to what is proportionate to its kind, or to any random thing—this has been stated previously. It has also been demonstrated how one might best be able to diagnose these accurately. What remains would be to discuss things that are such potentially, first explaining what the term \"potentially\" means. The explanation is brief, easy, and clear. For whatever does not yet exist as such as it is said to be, but is naturally disposed to become so, we say exists potentially: the newly born human is rational potentially, the bird is capable of flight, the dog is capable of hunting, and the horse is swift. What each of them is destined to become in any case, if nothing external impedes it, we speak of as if it already exists. Hence, I think, we say all these things exist potentially, not actually. For actuality is something complete and already present; but what is potential is something incomplete and still future, and as it were suitable for becoming, but not yet existing as what it is said to be. For neither is the infant already rational, but is going to become so, nor is the newly born dog already a hunter, at least not one that cannot yet see, but is so named because of its ability to hunt if it reaches maturity.\n\nMost properly, then, we say only those things exist potentially where nature itself arrives at completion, with nothing external impeding it. And also those that are the proximate matter of things that come to be. It makes no difference whether we say \"proximate,\" \"proper,\" or \"particular\"—for all of these indicate what is near and not through another intermediate change, as if you were to call blood potentially flesh, requiring minimal change for the generation of flesh. However, the digested food in the stomach is not the proximate matter of flesh, but becomes so through the intermediate stage of blood; still more remote are the food mass and bread. For these require three changes for the generation of flesh. Nevertheless, all these things are said to be potentially flesh. And before these, fire, air, water, earth, and their common matter. All these things are said more or less loosely. But the first way is the most proper of things said to exist potentially as something. Next is that according to proper matter, as if you say that smoky exhalation is potentially flame, or vapor is potentially air.\n\nSometimes \"potentially\" is also used in contradistinction to \"accidentally,\" as if someone should say that a cold bath heats the body of a well-fleshed youth—accidentally, then, by its proper power. In just so many ways, then, things potentially cold, dry, moist, and hot will be spoken of and properly investigated—why we call castor, euphorbium, pyrethrum, soapwort, natron, or misy hot, or lettuce, hemlock, mandrake, salamander, or poppy cold: whether they fall under the stated modes, or are spoken of in some other way not yet mentioned.\n\nFor asphalt, resin, fat, oil, and pitch are potentially hot because they easily become actually hot; for they catch fire very quickly, and when applied to our bodies they clearly heat them. But chalcitis, misy, mustard, natron, sweet flag, costus, and pyrethrum appear hot when applied to us, some more, some less, yet they are not naturally disposed to burst into flame. Either, then, those who consider only whether things easily burst into flame deceive themselves—for they should consider not this, but whether they become like glowing coals, as a coal is no less fire than flame. But flame comes from air being set on fire, or some airy body, while coal comes from earth or some earthy body being ignited.\n\nAnd indeed, up to this point the argument seems entirely consistent with itself, for it appears that those drugs which easily catch fire when touched by fire also heat us, except if something, due to its thick consistency, is not easily admitted into the body. For this will be distinguished more fully in the works on the powers of drugs. However, those things that appear to heat our body readily catch fire. How then, they say, do they not appear hot to the touch? I don't know why they say this. For if we were saying that each of the mentioned things is actually and already hot, it would indeed be surprising how they don't appear hot to the touch. But now, we call such things potentially hot because they can easily become hot. So it's not at all surprising if they don't yet heat those who touch them. For just as fire doesn't grow before the wood conquered by it is transformed—and this certainly happens in some period of time—in the same way neither does the heat in animals increase unless those drugs are first transformed by it.\n\nFor one is heated in one way by sitting near fire or in the sun, and in another way by each of the mentioned drugs. For the former are actually hot, but none of the drugs are. Therefore, they cannot heat us before they become actually such, and they receive actuality from us ourselves, just as dry reeds receive it from fire. Thus also wood is all cold according to its own nature, but the drier and smaller pieces easily change into fire, while the moister and larger ones need more time. So it's not surprising if drugs too need first to be broken into small, fine pieces, and second to interact with our bodies for some time, even if minimal, in order to become hot. But if you expect them to become hot already without breaking them up or heating them first, you seem to me to have forgotten what \"potentially hot\" means. For you test them as if they were actually hot.\n\nAnd indeed, it's not surprising if they need to be heated first in order to heat in return. For this happens also in the analogy of wood. They both preserve and increase a dying flame, being first heated by that very flame. So it's not unreasonable that the heat in animals uses such drugs as a kind of nourishment, as fire uses wood. For this indeed appears to happen. But if you apply any of them, made perfectly fine, to a chilled body, it doesn't heat at all. And for this reason we rub the chilled parts for a very long time with such drugs, both kindling heat by the rubbing and making rarified what was previously condensed by the cooling, so that the drug may penetrate inside and, interacting with the animal's innate heat, be transformed and heated.\n\nFor if even the smallest part of it should acquire heat actually, it thus spreads through the whole by continuity, as if you light the tip of a torch from a small spark; for fire easily spreads through all of this too, no longer needing the spark. Each of the potentially hot things, then, does not yet have the hot predominating over the cold in its nature, but is already close to predominating, so that it needs slight external assistance to prevail. And sometimes rubbing is sufficient to provide this, sometimes either fire or one of the naturally hot bodies touching it.\n\nSo it's not at all surprising to say why some things are naturally disposed to heat our body immediately upon touching it, while others do this over a longer time. For indeed, of things brought near fire, some catch immediately, like the wick, thin torch, pitch, and dry reed, while others, unless they remain near for a long time, are not overcome, like green wood.\n\nBut it would be more just to distinguish that point whose demonstration we will give in the works on natural faculties; but now, for the sake of the present discussion, we will use it hypothetically, saying that there are four proper faculties of every body: one attractive of what is proper, another retentive of the same, a third alterative, and fourth upon these, expulsive of what is foreign. And these same faculties belong to the whole substance of each body, which we say is mixed from hot and cold, dry and moist. But when a body changes what is near it according to any single quality in it, we must not suppose that it then acts according to its whole substance, nor that what is changed can be assimilated; so that what is thus changed would never nourish any of the changing agents. But if that should change—that is, act according to its whole substance—it would thus assimilate to itself and be nourished by what was changed. For nutrition is nothing other than complete assimilation.",

      "gemini_translation": "It has been stated previously, then, that we say each of the things that are actually hot, cold, dry, and moist is so either because it has received the quality to an extreme degree, or through the predominance of one of these qualities, or by comparing it to a well-proportioned [substance] of the same kind, or to any random thing. And it has also been shown how one might best be able to distinguish them accurately. It would therefore remain to go over those things that are such in potentiality, first explaining the term itself—what \"in potentiality\" [δυνάμει] signifies. And the explanation is brief, very easy, and clear. For whatever is not yet such as it is said to be, but is by nature apt to become so, we say exists in potentiality. For instance, we call a newborn human 'rational,' a young bird 'winged,' a dog 'a hunter,' and a horse 'swift'—speaking of what each of them will certainly become, provided nothing external impedes it, as if it already were so. Whence, I think, we say that all these things exist in potentiality, not in actuality [ἐνεργείᾳ]. For actuality is something complete and already present, whereas that which is 'in potentiality' is something incomplete and still in the future, and, as it were, suited to become so, but not yet being what it is called. For the infant is not yet rational, but is going to be; nor is the newborn puppy already a hunter—indeed, it cannot even see yet—but it is so named because of its ability to hunt, should it reach its full development.\n\nIn the strictest sense, therefore, we speak of things being 'in potentiality' only in cases where nature itself arrives at the complete state, provided nothing external impedes it. But we also use the term for whatever things are the proximate matters of things that come into being. It will make no difference whether one says 'proximate,' 'proper,' or 'particular' matter, for all these terms indicate that which is near and does not require another intermediate change—as when you might call blood 'flesh in potentiality,' since it requires only a very small change to become flesh. However, the food digested in the stomach is not the proximate matter of flesh, but becomes so through the medium of blood; still further removed is the barley-cake, and bread is even more distant. For it requires three changes to become flesh. Nevertheless, all these things too are said to be flesh in potentiality. And before them, fire, air, water, and earth, and the common matter of these very elements. All these, then, are so called by a greater or lesser extension of the term. But the first way is the strictest sense in which things are said to be some particular thing in potentiality. Next in order is the sense related to the proper matter, as when you say that a smoky exhalation is potentially flame, or that vapor is potentially air. The term 'in potentiality' is also sometimes used in contrast to what occurs 'accidentally' [κατὰ συμβεβηκός], as when one might say that a cold bath heats the body of a fleshy youth; this heating occurs accidentally, then, not according to the bath's proper power.\n\nIt is according to these many senses, then, that things potentially cold, dry, moist, and hot will be spoken of and duly investigated: for what reason do we say that castoreum, euphorbium, pellitory, soapwort, natron, or misy are hot, or that lettuce, hemlock, mandrake, salamander, or poppy are cold? Does this fall under the senses mentioned, or is it said in some other way not yet described? For asphalt, resin, and suet, as well as oil and pitch, are potentially hot because they easily become actually hot; for they are very quickly set aflame and most clearly heat our bodies when applied to them. But chalcanthite, misy, mustard, natron, sweet flag, may-apple, costus, and pellitory appear hot when applied to us, some more and some less, yet they are not by nature apt to be set aflame. Are those, then, who consider only this point—whether they are not easily set aflame—deluding themselves? For they should have examined not this, but whether they cannot be made to glow like charcoal, since charcoal is no less fire than flame is. But flame comes from air being ignited, or some airy body, whereas charcoal comes from earth, or some earthy body. And indeed, up to this point the account seems to be entirely consistent with itself, for it appears that all those drugs which are easily ignited when they touch fire also heat us, unless something, because it is of coarse particles, is not easily admitted into the body. For this will be defined more fully in the works *On the Powers of Drugs*. However, all things that are observed to heat our body are readily ignited.\n\n\"How is it, then,\" they say, \"that they do not seem hot to the touch?\" I do not know why they say this. For if we were saying that each of the aforementioned things is actually and already hot, it would surely be astonishing that they do not seem hot to the touch. But as it is, we call such things 'potentially' hot because of their ability to become hot easily. It is therefore no wonder that they do not yet heat those who touch them. For just as a fire does not grow before the wood, overcome by it, is transformed, and this certainly happens in some amount of time, in the same way drugs are not transformed by the heat in animals unless they are first acted upon by that heat itself. For a person warmed by a fire or in the sun is heated in one way, and a person heated by each of the aforementioned drugs in another. For the former are actually hot, but none of the drugs are. Therefore, they cannot heat us until they become actually so, and they receive this actuality from us ourselves, just as dry reeds do from the fire. Thus, all pieces of wood are cold according to their own nature, but those that are drier and smaller change into fire easily, while those that are moister and larger require more time. It is no wonder, then, if drugs also require first to be broken down into small, fine particles, and second, to be in contact with our bodies for some time, however short, in order to become hot. But if you expect them to become hot immediately, without having first broken them down or heated them, you seem to me to have forgotten what 'potentially hot' signifies. For you are testing them as if they were actually hot.\n\nAnd indeed, it is not surprising that a thing must first be heated in order to heat in return. For this happens also according to the analogy of the wood. At any rate, wood both preserves and increases a dying flame by first being heated by that very flame. It is therefore not at all unreasonable that the heat in animals uses such drugs as a kind of nourishment, just as fire uses wood. For this is indeed how it appears to happen. But if you were to sprinkle any of them, having worked it into a fine powder, onto a chilled body, it is not heated at all. And for this reason we rub chilled parts for a very long time with such drugs, at once kindling heat by the friction and rendering porous what was previously condensed by the cold, so that the drug may penetrate inside and, by interacting with the innate heat of the animal, be altered and heated. For if even the smallest part of it acquires heat in actuality, it thus transmits it to the whole in continuity, just as if you were to light the tip of a torch from a tiny spark; for the fire easily spreads over the whole torch, no longer needing the spark.\n\nEach of the things that are potentially hot, therefore, does not yet have in its nature a predominance of the hot over the cold, but it is already close to having this predominance, so that it requires little help from outside for the hot to prevail. And this help is sometimes sufficiently provided by friction, and at other times by fire or one of the naturally hot bodies touching it. It is therefore not at all surprising to say why some things are by nature able to heat our body in return as soon as they touch it, while others do this in a longer time. For among things brought near a fire, some ignite immediately, like a wick, a thin torch, pitch, and a dry reed, while others are not overcome unless they are near it for a long time, like green wood.\n\nBut it is more just to distinguish that other matter, the proof of which we shall state in the works *On the Natural Faculties*; but for the sake of the present discussion, we shall use it now hypothetically, stating that there are four proper faculties of every body: one, the attractive faculty for what is proper to it; a second, the retentive faculty for these same things; a third, the alterative; and fourth, after these, the expulsive faculty for what is foreign. And these same faculties belong to the whole substance of each body, which we say is a mixture of hot, cold, dry, and moist. But whenever a body alters a neighboring body according to any single one of the qualities within it, one must not suppose either that its whole substance is then acting, or that the thing being altered can be assimilated; so that nothing that alters in this way could ever be nourished by what is so altered. But if that body were to alter—that is, to act with its whole substance—it would thus assimilate the other to itself, and be nourished by what was altered. For nutrition is nothing other than complete assimilation.",

τοῖς τε περὶ στοιχείων καὶ τοῖς περὶ κράσεων λογισμοῖς.",
      "openai_translation": "Since this has been determined, we must again take our argument from that point. Each animal is nourished by foods proper to it; and “proper” food for each is whatever is able to be assimilated to the body that is nourished. Accordingly, the entire substance of what nourishes must have with the entire nature of what is nourished a certain community and likeness, though here too there is by all means no small difference in the “more and less” that belongs to them. For some things are more proper and similar, others less; and so in their processing some require stronger and more prolonged workmanship [i.e., digestion], others weaker and shorter. Thus bird-flesh needs less, pork more, and beef still more. Wine needs the least change for assimilation, whence it both nourishes and very quickly invigorates. Nevertheless, even it must associate with the peptic organs—the stomach, the liver, and the veins—in which, having first been worked upon, it can then nourish the body; before it undergoes change in these, it is not possible for it to become an animal’s food, even if it were laid upon the body from outside all day and night. Much less could bread laid upon the outside, or beet, or a barley-cake, nourish. So then, whatever things are in every way assimilated are foods; all the rest in general are called drugs [pharmaka]. And these too are twofold in kind. For either, remaining as they were when taken in, they overcome and alter the body—in the same way as the latter changes ordinary foods—and these are certainly drugs, poisons and destructive of an animal’s nature; or else, having taken the beginning of change from the body, they then rot and are corrupted, and thereafter corrupt and rot the body along with them. These too are poisons. There is a third kind among drugs: those which heat the body in reaction, yet work no harm. And a fourth: those which, while both acting and being acted upon, are overcome with time and are completely assimilated. It also happens with these that they are at once drugs and foods. Nor is it any wonder if some things, taking only a slight starting impulse, undergo a very great deviation from their original nature. Indeed, many such cases are observed even among external things. For in Mysia of Asia a house was once burned down in this way. There lay pigeon-dung, already rotted and warmed and sending up vapor, and hot enough to the touch; and close to it—indeed within reach—there was a small window whose wood had been freshly smeared with much resin. When then in the middle of summer a blazing sun struck upon it, he kindled both the resin and the wood. From there other doors and windows nearby, just lately smeared with resin, readily caught the fire and carried it up to the roof; and once the flame took hold of that, it quickly spread over the whole house. In just this way, I think, they also say that Archimedes set the enemy triremes ablaze by means of burning mirrors [burning-glasses]. Wool, tow, a wick, a giant-fennel stalk, and anything likewise dry and porous are readily kindled by a burning-glass. Sparks are also struck by rubbing stones together, and still more if one dusts them with sulfur. Such too was Medea’s drug. For everything to which it was smeared would be kindled when heat struck it. And that compound was prepared with sulfur and liquid bitumen [naphtha]. Indeed, someone even displayed it as a marvel: after snuffing out a lamp, he lit it again by bringing it up to a wall; another lit it by bringing it up to a stone—the wall and the stone, it turned out, had been sulfur-smeared. And once this was understood, what happened was no longer a marvel. All such drugs are not yet actually hot, but are most apt to become hot; therefore they are said to be hot in potency. About these, then, there is no difficulty, nor about why wine, when drunk, sufficiently warms the body, but when applied upon the skin does not warm. For it was shown a little earlier that it warms the living being not simply as a hot drug, but as a proper food. For as suitable fuels feed a fire, so whatever food is by nature proper and connatural to warm bodies will continuously refresh them and increase their innate heat. This is common to all food. Wine, however, has a special property: the speed of its change [i.e., assimilation], like torch-wood, wick, tow, and pitch. And keeping to the image of fire, let us recall damp wood: this too is fuel for fire, but not immediately, not at once; and for that reason, when a great deal of it is thrown on a fire, it smothers the flame and—especially if the flame is weak and small—brings the risk of its extinction. So too in animals, those foods which require time in order to be fully assimilated and nourish the body appear to bring on cold rather than heat at the moment. Yet in the long run they warm as well, in a way like other foods, if only the additional condition is met—that they actually nourish the body. For every food, by its own account, increases the animal’s heat. But if something is swallowed as food yet is not mastered [i.e., not assimilated], then we have what Hippocrates spoke of: it would be “food in name, not in deed.” For since “food” is said in a threefold way, as he himself taught when he said, “Food is that which nourishes; food is that which is like food; and that which is going to be [food],” the one that already nourishes—being added and no longer future—is properly called “food,” and it certainly warms the body that is nourished; of the other two, neither does, because they are not properly foods, but the one is “like food,” and the other is “what is going to become such.” Therefore even wine itself does not always warm the living being—just as oil does not always kindle a flame, though it is the most proper fuel for fire. If you pour oil in a mass and in quantity upon a weak, small flame, you will smother and completely extinguish it rather than increase it. So too with wine: whenever it is drunk in such quantity that it is not mastered, it so far is from warming the living being that it even produces colder affections. Apoplexies, paralytic stupors, deep lethargies, palsies, epilepsies, convulsions, and tetani follow upon immoderate drinking of wine—affections all of them cold. In general, whatever of the things taken into the body warms as food, you will find it at some time cooling—just as with the same material a flame is not only increased but is sometimes even quenched. All these points, then, seem to agree with the reasonings concerning the elements and concerning mixtures [kraseis, temperaments].",

      "claude_translation": "Since this has been determined, we must begin our discussion again from that point. Each animal is nourished by its proper foods; and proper food for each is whatever can be assimilated to the body being nourished. Therefore, the entire substance of the nourishing material must possess some community and similarity with the entire nature of what is nourished, though certainly here too there exists no small difference in degree of more and less among them. For some things are more proper and similar, others less so, so that some require stronger and more prolonged processing, while others need weaker and shorter processing. Chicken meat requires less, pork more, and beef still more. Wine requires the least transformation for assimilation, which is why it both nourishes and strengthens most quickly.\n\nIndeed, even wine must interact with the digestive organs—stomach, liver, and veins—in which, after being processed, it can then nourish the body. But before achieving transformation in these organs, it cannot become food for an animal, even if it were applied externally to the body for an entire day and night. Much more so is bread, or beet, or barley cake unable to nourish when applied externally. Therefore, things that are completely assimilated are foods; all others are called drugs. The nature of these too is twofold. For either they remain as they were taken in, overcoming and changing the body in the way the body changes foods—and these are certainly poisonous drugs destructive to the animal's nature—or, receiving the beginning of change from the body, they subsequently putrefy and are destroyed, and then jointly destroy and putrefy the body. These too are poisons.\n\nThere is a third type of drugs beyond these, which warm the body but cause no harm. And a fourth type: those which both act and are acted upon, are overcome in time, and are completely assimilated. It happens that these are both drugs and foods. It is not surprising if some things, taking a small starting point, undergo the greatest deviation from their original nature. For many such things are observed externally. In Mysia in Asia, a house once burned down in the following way. Pigeon dung was stored, already putrefied and heated, giving off vapor and quite warm to the touch. Near this, close enough to touch, was a window frame with wood recently smeared with much resin. In midsummer, the fierce sun striking it ignited the resin and the wood. From there, other nearby doors and window frames recently smeared with resin easily caught the fire and extended it to the roof. Once the flame seized that, it quickly spread through the entire house.\n\nIn this way, I think, they say Archimedes set fire to enemy triremes using burning-mirrors. Wool, tow, wick-material, fennel-stalk, and anything similarly dry and porous readily ignites from a burning-glass. Stones rubbed together also produce flame, especially if one sprinkles sulfur on them. Medea's drug was of this type—everything ignites when heat is applied to whatever has been smeared with it. That too is prepared from sulfur and liquid asphalt. Indeed, someone demonstrated something remarkable: extinguishing a lamp, he relit it by bringing it to a wall; another brought it to a stone. Both the wall and stone had been treated with sulfur. Once this was understood, the phenomenon was no longer remarkable.\n\nAll these drugs are not yet completely hot, but are most suited to becoming hot; therefore they are called potentially hot. About these there is no difficulty. Nor is there difficulty about why wine drunk heats the body considerably, but applied to the skin does not heat it. For it was shown a little earlier that it heats the animal not simply as a hot drug, but as proper food. For just as suitable fuel for fire increases the fire, so whatever is proper and natural food for naturally hot bodies will always strengthen them and increase their innate heat. This is common to all food. But wine has the exceptional property of speed of transformation, like a torch, wick, tow, or pitch.\n\nHolding to the image of fire, we recall again wet wood, which is also fuel for fire, but not immediately or instantly. Therefore, when much is thrown on the fire, it both conceals the flame and, especially if it is weak and small, brings danger of extinction. Thus in animals too, those foods which require time to be completely assimilated and nourish the body appear to bring cold rather than warmth immediately. Yet these too warm in time, similarly to other foods, if only they succeed in nourishing the body. For all food according to its own nature increases the animal's heat.\n\nBut if something is consumed as food yet not mastered, this would be what Hippocrates said: the name of food but not the function. For since food is spoken of in three ways, as he himself taught by saying \"Food is what nourishes, food is what is like food, and what will be\"—that which is already nourishing and being added and no longer future is properly called food and certainly warms the nourished body. But neither of the others does, because they are not properly foods, but one is \"like food,\" the other because it will become such.\n\nTherefore wine itself does not always warm the animal, just as oil does not ignite flame, though it is most proper fuel for fire. But if you pour oil abundantly and in quantity on a weak and small flame, you will smother and completely extinguish it rather than increase it. Thus wine too, when drunk in such quantity that it cannot be mastered, is so far from warming the animal that it produces colder conditions. For apoplexy, paralysis, stupor, coma, palsy, epilepsy, convulsions, and tetanus follow immoderate wine drinking—all cold conditions. In general, you would find that whatever taken into the body warms as food sometimes cools, just as flame is not only increased but sometimes extinguished by the same material. These things seem to agree entirely with the theories about elements and about mixtures.",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 2:**\n\nNow that this has been determined, we must begin the argument again from that point. Each animal is nourished by its own proper foods; and a proper food for each is whatever can be assimilated by the body being nourished. The entire substance of the nutrient must therefore possess a certain affinity and similarity to the entire nature of the body being nourished, although there is certainly no small difference of degree among them in this respect as well. For some things are more proper and similar, and others less so, with the result that some require a stronger and more prolonged processing, while others need one that is weaker and shorter. Thus, the meat of birds requires less processing, that of pigs more, and that of cattle still more. Wine, however, requires the least change for assimilation, for which reason it both nourishes and invigorates most quickly. To be sure, wine too must interact with the digestive organs—the stomach, liver, and veins—in which, having been pre-processed, it can then nourish the body. But before it undergoes the change within these organs, it is not possible for it to become nourishment for an animal, even if it were applied to the outside of the body for a whole day and night. And it is much more impossible for bread, or beet, or barley-cake to provide nourishment when applied externally.\n\nTherefore, things that are completely assimilated are foods; all other things are called drugs [pharmaka]. And the nature of these drugs is twofold. For either, remaining as they were taken in, they overcome and alter the body in the same way that the body alters foods—and these are in every case poisonous drugs, destructive to the animal's nature; or, receiving the beginning of a change from the body, they thereupon putrefy and are corrupted, and then they corrupt and cause the body to putrefy along with them. And these too are poisons. And there is a third class of drugs besides these: those that heat the body in turn but do no harm. And a fourth: those which, while both acting and being acted upon, are overcome in time and are completely assimilated. It is the case for these that they are at once both drugs and foods.\n\nAnd it is not at all surprising if some things, by taking hold of a small starting-point, undergo a very great deviation from their original nature. At any rate, many such things are seen even in the external world. For in Mysia in Asia, a house once burned down in the following way. A pile of pigeon dung lay there, already putrefied, heated, and giving off vapor, and quite warm to the touch. Near this, so close as to be touching it, was a window-shutter with wood freshly smeared with much resin. It was the middle of summer, and a fierce sun, beating down upon it, ignited the resin and the wood. And from there, some other doors and shutters nearby, which had also been recently smeared with resin, easily caught the fire in turn and extended it up to the roof. And once the flame took hold of that, it quickly spread over the whole house. It was in some such way, I believe, that they say Archimedes set fire to the enemy's triremes with his burning-glasses. Wool, tow, a lamp-wick, and a fennel-stalk are also readily kindled by a burning-glass, as is anything that is similarly dry and porous. Stones, too, when rubbed against each other, ignite a flame, especially if one sprinkles some sulfur on them. And Medea's drug was of such a kind; at any rate, it ignites whatever it is smeared on when heat is applied. That drug is also prepared with both sulfur and liquid bitumen. Indeed, someone once demonstrated a marvel: extinguishing a lamp, he lit it again by bringing it to a wall; another did so by bringing it to a stone. It turned out that both the wall and the stone had been treated with sulfur. And when this was known, the event was no longer a marvel. All these drugs, therefore, are not yet actually hot, but are most suitable for becoming hot; and for this reason they are said to be potentially hot [dynamei therma].\n\nConcerning these matters, then, there is no difficulty. Nor is there any difficulty as to why wine, when drunk, sufficiently heats the body, but when applied to the skin, does not heat it. For it was shown a little earlier that it heats the animal not simply like a hot drug, but as a proper food. For just as the suitable foods of a fire make the fire grow, so too for naturally hot bodies, whatever is a proper and congenital food will always strengthen them and increase their innate heat. And this is common to all food. But wine has the special, exceptional quality of speed of transformation, like a torch, a wick, tow, and pitch. And indeed, holding to the image of fire, we will call to mind again wet wood, which is also food for the fire, but not immediately or instantly. For this reason, when a lot of it is thrown on a fire, it hides the flame, and especially if the fire is weak and small, it brings the danger of extinction. So too in animals, whatever foods require time to be completely assimilated and to nourish the body, appear to bring on cold rather than warmth in the immediate moment. Yet in time these too produce heat, just like other foods, if only they succeed in nourishing the body. For all food, in accordance with its own nature, increases the heat of the animal. But if it should be swallowed as food, but not be mastered by the body, this would be that which was spoken of by Hippocrates: \"it would have the name of food, but not the reality.\" For since nourishment is spoken of in three ways, as he himself taught when he said, \"Nourishment is that which nourishes, nourishment is that which is like nourishment, and that which is going to be,\" the one that is already nourishing and being added to the body, and is no longer \"going to be,\" is called nourishment in the proper sense, and it certainly heats the body being nourished. But neither of the others is, because they are not nourishment in the proper sense, but one is \"like nourishment,\" and the other is so called because it is \"going to be\" such.\n\nFor these reasons, then, wine itself does not always heat the animal, just as oil does not always kindle a flame, even though it is a most proper food for fire. But if you pour a great quantity of oil all at once on a weak and small flame, you will smother and completely extinguish it rather than make it grow. So too with wine, when so much is drunk that it cannot be mastered, it is so far from heating the animal that it even generates colder affections. At any rate, apoplexies, paraplexies, stupors, comas, paralyses, epilepsies, spasms, and tetanus—all cold affections—follow upon immoderate consumption of wine. For in general, whatever things taken into the body as food are heating, you would find that these sometimes have a cooling effect, in the same way that a flame is not only increased by the same matter, but sometimes even extinguished by it. All these things, then, seem to agree with the reasonings concerning both the elements and the mixtures [kraseis].",

      "openai_translation": "That point, perhaps, may seem to differ: that certain things which are eaten, though needed as food, when applied upon the skin, corrode and ulcerate it—like mustard and salted fish, and garlic and onions. And yet this agrees with the principles set down at the start: partly because they are transformed and altered, being digested in the stomach and then becoming blood in the veins; in addition, because they do not remain in one place but are divided up and carried everywhere into many parts; and further, because they are mixed both with many juices [humors] and with the foods taken along with them; and further still, because both their digestion and their separation take place quickly, so that what is akin is assimilated, while the superfluous, sharp part in them is excreted through the stomach and at the same time through urine and sweat. For all these reasons, what ulcerates from without does not ulcerate when eaten. Indeed, even if any one of the points mentioned belonged to them, it would surely be sufficient to keep the external parts unharmed—for instance, if to begin with they happened to change. For if mustard does not remain such as it was when applied externally, it is clear you will not deem that its power remains either. And if it is also separated out and purged away, then all the more so. It would have sufficed too that it not linger in one region. For it appears that nothing capable of acting on the skin does anything without a considerable time. And the fact that it is mixed with many other foods is no small matter either. You would realize this, if you were to administer it alone, apart from the other foods, how much distress and smarting it brings upon the stomach. And indeed, if you were to apply it upon the skin, mixed with many sweet juices, it would do no serious harm. When, therefore, each of the points mentioned is in itself sufficient to prevent mustard from doing inside what it did outside upon the skin, surely much more so, I think, when all of them come together at once. For it is altered in digestion, and it is separated, and it is purged away, and it is mixed with many other things, and it is divided in many ways, and it is carried everywhere, and it lingers in none of the parts. And that, if it did remain sharp, it would certainly ulcerate the internal parts too, you may recognize from spontaneous ulcerations. For it happens often to many—some through bad foods, others through the so‑called dyscrasia arising from some decay and putrefaction in the body itself. In these people at times some of the internal parts ulcerate; but most often, since the superfluities which wear down the nature according to their condition are rubbed off toward the skin, this is what becomes ulcerated in many with frequent and persistent sores. For cancer, and phagedena, and the creeping herpes that eats upward, and carbuncles, and the ulcers called cheironeia and telephia, and countless other kinds of sores, are offspring of such dyscrasia. Thus none of these things is puzzling, nor why some drugs, which do us no harm externally, produce great evil when swallowed; while some, when taken internally, have at times harmed and at times helped; and some do harm not only internally but also externally. In a word, nothing by nature acts in the same way from within and from without. For neither the foam of a rabid dog nor the poison of the asp nor that of the viper—things believed to harm even when they fall upon us externally without a wound—have the same power when they merely touch the skin as when taken within. Nor, indeed, is it worthy of wonder if the power of certain drugs does not reach in depth; it is not necessary that all have the same strength. And if many things taken inwardly, at one time—at such‑and‑such a moment, and with such a quantity, and in mixture with such things—have helped, but when taken at the wrong time, and in large amounts, and unmixed, have caused harm, there is no difficulty in the reasoning on that account. For this holds also of foods, and of fire, and likewise of all things that affect the body. For there are times when we need a moderate flame, and by using it we gain great benefit from it, although an immoderate one burns us. So too the drinking of cold—when moderate—benefits, but when immoderate harms most severely. What, then, is surprising if there is some drug hot in power to such a degree that, if much of it were taken and offered to a body that is empty, it would corrode and utterly burn it, but if it were little, or given together with things that restrain its strength, then, besides doing no harm, it would even help by warming? For the sap [latex]—whether the Cyrenaic, or the Median, or the Parthian—cannot be taken by itself without pain; but if it be taken in a very small amount, or together with other things at the suitable time, it greatly helps. In this way, then, whatever warms the body, having received in it a starting‑point of change, as was said before, is naturally disposed to be warmed in return by it again; but whatever cools—like the latex of the poppy [opium]—is not changed by the body even a little, but immediately overpowers and changes it, even if you administer it heated. For their very nature is cold, as is water. Therefore, this too has been rightly said by Aristotle along with many other points: that among warm and cold and dry and moist bodies, some are such in themselves, others only incidentally. For instance, water is cold in itself, but incidentally at times hot. But the heat it acquires from without quickly perishes, while its innate coldness remains. So just as water, even when hot, quenches a flame when poured on it, so also the poppy‑latex, even if you administer it as heated as possible, will chill the heat in living beings and bring on a danger of death. All such drugs, then, when given in small doses and with things capable of curbing the intensity of their cooling, at times provide some benefit to our bodies, as will be said in the works on drugs. For indeed the preparation through cantharides helps those with dropsy quite sufficiently, although as a rule the cantharis ulcerates the bladder; but when it is both curbed by what is mixed with it and administered to a body that contains very much moisture, it empties it through the urine. One must therefore pay very close attention, in all things said to be hot or cold in power, whether they belong to the nature of things capable of nourishing, or whether they merely receive an occasion for alteration and then, being altered according to their own nature, dispose the body in some way; and, thirdly, in addition, whether they are not altered by it at all in any respect. For if it belongs to the class of things that nourish: if it be mastered [by the body], it warms; if it is not mastered, it cools. But if it belongs to those altered only for a short time in respect of quantity, it certainly warms. If it belongs to those not altered at all, it most of all cools.",

Yet this actually agrees with our initial premises. For simultaneously: they are changed and altered when digested in the stomach and when converted to blood in the veins; moreover, they do not remain in one place but are divided into many parts and carried everywhere; furthermore, they are mixed with many humors and with other foods taken at the same time; and additionally, their digestion occurs quickly, as does their separation, so that what is suitable is assimilated while what is excessive and sharp in them is expelled through the bowels, urine, and sweat. For all these reasons, what ulcerates externally does not ulcerate when eaten.\n\nIndeed, if even one of the aforementioned conditions existed for them, it would surely be sufficient to keep the external parts unharmed—for instance, if we take first the fact of transformation. For if mustard does not remain such as it was when taken externally, it is clear that you would not expect its power to remain either. And if it is also separated and purified, this is even more the case. The fact that it does not linger in one place would also suffice. For it appears unable to act upon the skin without considerable time. But also its mixing with many other foods is itself no small matter. You would know this if you were to take it alone without other foods—how much distress and irritation it brings to the stomach. And indeed, if you were to mix it with many sweet humors and apply it to the skin, it would cause no harm.\n\nTherefore, since each of the mentioned factors is sufficient by itself to prevent mustard from doing internally what it does externally when applied to the skin, I think this is much more the case when all factors come together. For it is altered when digested, and separated, and purified, and mixed with many other things, and divided in many ways, and carried everywhere, and lingers in no part of the body. That if it remained sharp, it would certainly ulcerate the internal parts too, you may recognize from spontaneous ulcers. For many people often develop what is called cacochymia [bad humor], some from bad foods, others from some corruption and putrefaction in the body itself. And in these cases sometimes something internal is ulcerated; but mostly, because nature expels the superfluities in the body's condition toward the skin, this becomes ulcerated with many continuous ulcers. For cancer, phagedena [spreading ulcer], corrosive herpes, carbuncles, and what are called chironian and telephian ulcers, and countless other types of ulcers are offspring of such cacochymia.\n\nTherefore, none of these things is puzzling, nor why certain drugs that do us no harm externally cause great evil when swallowed; while some often harm when taken internally but often benefit; and some harm not only internally but also externally. To speak generally, nothing naturally acts the same way internally and externally. For neither the foam of a rabid dog, nor the venom of the asp or viper—which are believed to harm even when falling on the skin externally without a wound—have the same power whether merely coming into contact with the skin or being taken internally.\n\nNor is it worth wondering if the power of certain drugs does not reach to the depths; for not all necessarily have the same strength. And if many things taken internally benefit at this particular time, with this particular quantity, and with this particular mixture, but cause harm when taken at the wrong time, in large amounts, and unmixed, this presents no difficulty for our argument. For this applies to foods, to fire, and similarly to everything that affects the body. We sometimes need moderate flame and derive great benefit from using it, even though excessive flame burns us. Similarly, a moderate drink of cold water benefits, but an excessive one causes extreme harm.\n\nWhat wonder then if there is some drug so hot in power that if taken in large quantity and given to an empty body, it completely corrodes and burns it, but if little or given with things that check its strength, not only does it not harm but even benefits by warming? For instance, juice—whether Cyrenaic, Median, or Parthian—cannot be taken by itself without pain; but if very little, or with other things at the appropriate time, it greatly benefits. In this way then, whatever warms the body, having taken in it a beginning of change as previously stated, naturally warms it in return; but whatever cools, like poppy juice, is not changed by the body even slightly, but immediately overcomes and changes it, even if you give it warmed. For their nature is cold, just as water is.\n\nRightly then has Aristotle said this among many other things: that of hot, cold, dry, and wet bodies, some are such in themselves, others accidentally. For instance, water is cold in itself but sometimes accidentally hot. But its acquired heat is quickly lost, while its innate coldness remains. Therefore, just as hot water thrown on flame extinguishes it, so also poppy juice, even if you give it as warm as possible, will cool the heat in animals and bring danger of death.\n\nAll such drugs, then, when given in small amounts and with things able to check the violence of their cooling, sometimes provide some use to our bodies, as will be discussed in the works on drugs. For indeed the drug made from cantharides [Spanish fly] sufficiently benefits those with dropsy, although the cantharides generally ulcerate the bladder; but when it is checked by things mixed with it and applied to a body containing very much moisture, it empties this through the urine.\n\nTherefore one must especially pay attention in all things said to be hot or cold in power, whether they are of the nature of things able to nourish, or only take a starting point of alteration and then, being altered according to their own nature, somehow affect the body, and third beyond these, whether they are not altered by it at all in any way. For if they are of the genus of nourishing things, if overcome they warm, but if not overcome they cool; if of things altered to a small degree, they certainly warm; but if of things not altered at all, they especially cool.",

τοιούτων, ξηρὰ ταῖς οὐσίαις ὑπάρχοντα, πολλῷ θερμῷ τακέντα, φαντασίαν ὑγρότητος ἔλαβεν, ὡς χαλκὸς καὶ σίδηρος· ἢ καθ’ ἑαυτὰ μέν ἐστιν ὑγρὰ, καθάπερ ὁ κρύσταλλος, ἀκράτῳ δὲ ψύξει πλησιάζοντα, ξηρὰ

γάρ ἐστι δυνάμει θερμὸν, ὅτι ῥᾳδίως φλὸξ γίνεται. κατὰ ταὐτὰ δὲ καὶ ῥητίνη, καὶ ἄσφαλτος, καὶ πίττα. οἶνος δὲ, διότι ῥᾳδίως αἷμα γίνεται. κατὰ ταὐτὰ δὲ καὶ μέλι, καὶ κρέας, καὶ γάλα. ταυτὶ μὲν οὖν, ὅλαις ἀλλοιούμενα ταῖς οὐσίαις, τροφαὶ τῶν ἀλλοιούντων εἰσί. τὰ δὲ κατὰ μίαν ἡντιναοῦν ποιότητα τὴν ἀλλοίωσιν ἴσχοντά τε καὶ τρεπόμενα, φάρμακα μόνον, ὥσπερ γε καὶ ὅσα ταῖς ὅλαις ἑαυτῶν οὐσίαις ἄτρεπτα μένοντα διατίθησι τὸ σῶμα, φάρμακα μέν ἐστι καὶ ταῦτα· χαλεπὰ δὲ καὶ φθαρτικὰ τῆς τοῦ ζώου φύσεως· ὅθεν περ, οἶμαι, καὶ τὸ γένος αὐτῶν ἅπαν ὀνομάζεται δηλητήριον. οὐ γὰρ δὴ διὰ τοῦτό γε λεκτέον οὐκ εἶναι τῷ γένει δηλητήρια τὰ τοιαῦτα, διότι παντελῶς ἐλάχιστα προσαχθέντα βλάβην οὐδὲ μίαν αἰσθητὴν ἐπιφέρει. οὕτω γὰρ ἂν οὐδὲ τὸ πῦρ εἴη θερμὸν, οὐδ’ ἡ χιὼν ψυχρά· ὡς καὶ τούτων γε παντάπασι τὰ σμικρὰ σαφὲς οὐδὲν ἀποτελεῖ περὶ τοῖς σώμασιν ἡμῶν πάθος. σπινθῆρος γὰρ ἑνὸς ἑκατοστὸν μέρος ἔστι μὲν πάντως τῷ γένει πῦρ, ἀλλ’ οὐ μόνον οὐκ ἂν ἡμᾶς καύσειεν ἢ θερμῄνειεν, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἄν αἴσθησίν τινα παράσχοι προσπεσόν. οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὸ τῆς ψυχρᾶς ῥανίδος ἑκατοστὸν μέρος οὐ μόνον οὐδὲν ἂν βλάψειεν ἢ ψύξειεν, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἂν αἴσθησίν τινα παράσχοι. μὴ τοίνυν οὕτως μηδὲ τὰ δηλητήρια

διαφθείρεσθαι τὴν φύσιν ἡμῶν συμβαίνει. πάντα γὰρ τὰ τοιαῦτα τῷ γένει δηλητήρια, κᾂν διὰ σμικρότητά ποτε μηδὲν αἰσθητὸν ἀπεργάζηται. τὰ μὲν δὴ διαβιβρώσκοντα καὶ σήποντα καὶ τήκοντα τὴν τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν φύσιν εἰκότως ὀνομάζεται δυνάμει θερμά· τὰ δ’ αὖ ψύχοντα καὶ ναρκοῦντα ψυχρά. τὰ μὲν οὖν πρότερα παράλογον οὐδὲν οὔτε αὐτὰ πάσχειν, οὔτε τοῖς σώμασιν ἡμῶν ἐναπεργάζεσθαι δοκεῖ. θερμῷ γὰρ σώματι πλησιάσαντα, καί τινα ῥοπὴν ἀλλοιώσεως ἐντεῦθεν λαβόντα, τὰ μὲν εἰς ἐσχάτην ἀφικνεῖται θερμότητα, τὰ δ’ εἰς σηπεδόνα. διατίθησιν οὖν εἰκότως καὶ τὰ τῶν ζώων σώματα κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτῶν διάθεσιν. ὅσα δὲ ψύχει τὸ σῶμα, κᾂν θερμῄνας αὐτὰ προσενέγκῃς, ἀπορίαν οὐ σμικρὰν ἐπιφέρει, τίνος ποτὲ φύσεώς ἐστιν. εἰ γὰρ ἅπαξ ἐνεργείᾳ θερμὰ γέγονε, τί οὐ θερμαίνει τὸ ζῶον; ἢ εἰ μήπω τεθέρμανται, πῶς φαίνεται θερμά; λύσις δὲ τῆς ἀπορίας, εἰ διορισθείη τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸ ψυχρὸν τοῦ κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς, ὡς Ἀριστοτέλης ἐδίδαξεν. ἀπόλλυται γὰρ ἐν τάχει τῶν κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς θερμῶν ἡ ἐπίκτητος διάθεσις, ὥστ’ εἰς τὴν ἀρχαίαν αὐτὰ φύσιν ἐπανέρχεσθαι ῥᾳδίως. ἐν δὲ τῷ πλησιάζειν ἡμῖν τὰ φύσει μὲν ψυχρὰ, κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς δὲ θερμὰ, δύο ταῦτ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης γίνεται· τὸ μὲν ἐπίκτητον αὐτῶν ἀπόλλυται θερμὸν, ἡ δ’ οἰκεία κρᾶσις, οὐδὲν ὑπὸ τῆς ἡμετέρας πάσχουσα, μένει ψυχρά, καὶ τί θαυμαστὸν, εἰ μήκωνος ὀπὸς, ἢ μανδραγόρας, ἢ κώνειον, ἤ τι τῶν τοιούτων, εἶ καὶ θερμανθέντα προσενεχθείης, μικρὸν ὕστερον γίνεται ψυχρά; πτισσάνης, καὶ γάλακτος, καὶ χόνδρου, καὶ ἄρτου, τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο πασχόντων, ἐπειδὰν εἰς ἄῤῥωστον ἐμπεσόντα γαστέρα μὴ κρατηθῇ πρὸς αὐτῆς· ἐμεῖται γοῦν πολλάκις ἱκανῶς ψυχρά. καὶ τό γε τούτων μεῖζον, ὃ δὴ καὶ Ἱπποκράτης ἐπεσημῄνατο· καίτοι χυμὸς ὂν ἤδη τὸ φλέγμα, κᾀκ τῶν σιτίων τῶν μὴ πεφθέντων πολλάκις ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ γεννώμενος, ὅμως ψυχρὸν ἁπτομένοις φαίνεται, οὐ μόνον ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ συστὰν, ἀλλὰ κᾀκ τῶν φλεβῶν αὐτῶν ὑπό τινος τῶν καθαιρόντων φαρμάκων ἑλχθέν. καί τοί γε γλισχρότατόν ἐστι σφόδρα, καὶ βιαίως ἄγεται, ἀλλ’ ὅμως οὐδ’ ἡ βία τῆς ὁλκῆς ἐκθερμαίνειν αὐτὸ δύναται. τί οὖν θαυμαστὸν, εἰ καὶ τὸ μηκώνειον, οὕτως ἐναντίον ἡμῶν τῇ φύσει φάρμακον, ἀποψύχεται μὲν αὐτίκα μάλα, κᾂν θερμὸν ποθῇ, συγκαταψύχει δ’ ἑαυτῷ τὸ σῶμα. τὴν γὰρ ἐπίκτητον οὐ φυλάττει θερμασίαν, ὅτι φύσει ψυχρὸν ἦν· τῷ δὲ μηδ’ ἀλλοιοῦσθαι τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτοῦ πρὸς ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ἀλλοιοῦν τε καὶ μεταβάλλειν ἡμᾶς, οὔτε θερμαίνεταί τι πρὸς ἡμῶν, αὐτό τε διατίθησιν ἡμᾶς καθ’ αὑτό· ψυχρὸν οὖν ὑπάρχον φύσει, ψύχει δήπου καὶ ἡμᾶς. οὐκοῦν οὐκέτ’ ἄπορον οὐδὲν ὑπόλοιπον ἐν τῷ λόγῳ. καὶ γὰρ δὴ καὶ ὅτι τούτων ἁπάντων τῶν φύσει ψυχρῶν ὅ τι ἂν ἐπὶ πλέον ἐκθερμῄνης, ἐξίσταται τῆς ἰδίας φύσεως, πρὸς τῷ μηδὲν ἄπορον ἔχειν, ἔτι καὶ μαρτυρεῖ τοῖς εἰρημένοις. ὡς γὰρ καὶ ἡ σαλαμάνδρα μέχρι μέν τινος ὑπὸ πυρὸς οὐδὲν πάσχει, κατακαίεται δ’, εἰ πλείονι χρόνῳ τῷ πυρὶ πλησιάσειεν, οὕτω καὶ ὁ μανδραγόρας, καὶ κώνειον, καὶ ψύλλιον, ἐπὶ βραχὺ μὲν ὁμιλήσαντα τῷ πυρὶ, τὴν οἰκείαν ἔτι διαφυλάττει κρᾶσιν, ἐπὶ πλέον δὲ θερμανθέντα, διαφθείρεται παραχρῆμα, καὶ δρᾷν οὐκέτι οὐδὲν ὧν πρότερον ἐπεφύκει δύναται. τῶν μὲν δὴ τοιούτων ἁπάντων ἡ φύσις ἐναντιωτάτη τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐστί· φύσιν δ’ ὅταν εἴπω, τὴν ὅλην οὐσίαν τε καὶ κρᾶσιν λέγω, τὴν ἐκ τῶν πρώτων στοιχείων, θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ, καὶ ξηροῦ καὶ ὑγροῦ· τῶν δὲ τάχιστα τρεφόντων οἰκειοτάτη. τὰ δ’ ἄλλα πάντα μεταξὺ τούτων ἐστί· τὰ μὲν μᾶλλον, τὰ δ’ ἧττον δρᾷν καὶ πάσχειν ὑπὸ τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν δυνάμενα. καστόριον μὲν γὰρ καὶ πέπερι δρᾷν μᾶλλον ἢ πάσχειν ὑπὸ τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν δυνάμενα· οἶνος δὲ καὶ μέλι καὶ πτισσάνη πάσχειν μᾶλλον ἢ δρᾷν. ἅπαντα οὖν ταῦτα καὶ πάσχει τι καὶ δρᾷ περὶ τὸ σῶμα. καθ’ ὅλου γὰρ ἐπειδὰν εἰς ταὐτὸ ἀλλήλοις ἥκοντα διαμάχηταί τε καὶ στασιάζῃ πρὸς ἄλληλα περὶ τῆς ἀλλοιώσεως ἐν χρόνῳ πλείονι, δρᾷν καὶ πάσχειν ἑκάτερον αὐτῶν ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστιν. ἴσως δὲ, κᾂν μὴ πολλῷ πάνυ χρόνῳ γίγνηται τοῦτο, δρᾷ μὲν ἔτι καὶ τότε τὸ νικώμενον εἰς τὸ κρατοῦν, ἀλλ’ οὕτω σμικρὸν, ὡς λανθάνειν τὴν αἴσθησιν. οὐδὲ γὰρ ὁ τμητικώτατος σίδηρος εἰ τὸν μαλακώτατον τέμνει κηρὸν δι’ ὅλης ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς, ἀδύνατον αὐτῷ μὴ οὐκ ἀμβλὺν γενέσθαι σαφῶς. οὕτω δή που κᾀκεῖνο καλῶς εἰρῆσθαι δοκεῖ, Πέτρην κοιλαίνει ῥανὶς ὕδατος ἐνδελεχείῃ. καὶ γὰρ καὶ φαίνεται γινόμενον οὕτως. ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ μὲν μιᾶς ἢ καὶ δευτέρας προσβολῆς οὐδὲν οὔπω σαφὲς ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις ἰδεῖν ἐστιν. ὅθεν, οἶμαι, καὶ τὸ μηδ’ ὅλως πάσχειν ἔνια πρὸς τῶν ὁμιλούντων ἐδοξάσθη τισί· καὶ συγχωρητέον γε τοῖς οὕτω λέγουσι. πολλάκις δὲ καὶ αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς ὁμοίως ἐκείνοις λεκτέον ἐστὶ τὰ πολλά· πλὴν εἴ ποτε μέχρι τῆς ἐσχάτης ἀκριβείας ἀνάγοιμεν τὸν λόγον, ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ παρόντι ποιοῦμεν. οὕτως οὖν καὶ τὸ τῆς ἀειπαθείας δόγμα, τῷ λόγῳ μὲν αὐτῷ μόνῳ σκοποῦσιν, ἰσχυρὰν ἔχει τὴν ἀπόδειξιν. οὐ μὴν χρεία γέ τίς ἐστιν αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὰς κατὰ μέρος πράξεις. ἂν γὰρ οὕτω μικρά τινα περὶ ἡμᾶς ᾖ πάθη διὰ παντὸς, ὡς μηδεμίαν αἰσθητὴν καὶ σαφῆ βλάβην ἐνεργείας ἐργάζεσθαι μηδεμιᾶς, εὐκαταφρόνητα δήπουθέν ἐστι, καὶ τῷ μηδὲν εἶναι φάσκοντι τὰ τοιαῦτα συγχωρητέον. οὕτως οὖν ἔχει κᾀπὶ τῶν τρεφόντων, ὀλίγου δεῖν, ἁπάντων. ἐργάζεται μὲν γάρ τι καὶ ταῦτα περὶ τὸ σῶμα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἀλλ’ οὐκ αἰσθητὸν, οὐδὲ σαφές τι καθάπαξ. ἡ μέντοι πολυχρόνιος αὐτῶν προσφορὰ μεγάλως ἀλλοιοῖ καὶ μεταβάλλει σαφῶς ἤδη τὰ σώματα. ἔνια μέν γε καὶ κατὰ τὴν πρώτην χρῆσιν εὐθὺς ἐναργῶς ἐνδείκνυται τὴν ἀλλοίῳσιν, οἶον καὶ ἡ θριδακίνη, τοὺς μὲν ἐγκαιομένους τὴν γαστέρα σαφῶς ἐμψύχουσά τε καὶ ἀδίψους ἐργαζομένη, τοὺς δὲ κατεψυγμένους ἐναργῶς βλάπτουσα. συντελεῖ δ’ οὐ σμικρὰ καὶ τοῖς ὕπνοις, οὐ κατ’ ἄλλον τινὰ λόγον, ἀλλ’ ὅτι ψυχρά τέ ἐστι καὶ ὑγρὰ τὴν κρᾶσιν· ἀλλ’ οὕτως ὑγρὰ καὶ ψυχρὰ πρὸς ἄνθρωπόν τε καὶ τἄλλ’, ὅσα τρέφειν πέφυκεν, ὡς καὶ τὰ ξύλα τὰ χλωρὰ πρὸς τὸ πῦρ. ὥστ’ εὐλόγως ἄμφω τοῖς τοιούτοις ἐδέσμασιν ὑπάρχει, τό θ’ ὡς φαρμάκοις διατιθέναι τὰ σώμαθ’ ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸ τρέφειν, παρ’ ὅλον μὲν τὸν χρόνον τῆς πέψεως, ὡς φαρμάκοις· ἡνίκα δ’ ἤδη τρέφει τε καὶ τελέως ὁμοιοῦται, τότ’ οὐκέτ’ οὐδὲν ἡμᾶς ἀντιδρῶντα, τὴν ἔμφυτον αὔξει θερμασίαν, ὡς καὶ πρόσθεν εἴρηται. κοινὸν γὰρ ἤδη τῶν τρεφόντων ἁπάντων ἐστὶ, καὶ οὐ χρὴ θαυμάζειν, εἴ τι, πρὶν μὲν ἐξομοιοῦσθαι καὶ τρέφειν, ἔτι πεττόμενον ἔψυχεν, ἐξομοιωθὲν δὲ καὶ θρέψαν, ἐθέρμῃνε, μεμνημένους ἀεὶ τοῦ τῶν χλωρῶν ξύλων παραδείγματος. ὥστε καὶ ἡ χρεία τῶν τοιούτων ἁπάντων διττὴ τοῖς ἰατροῖς ἐστι, καὶ ὡς σιτίων, καὶ ὡς φαρμάκων. φέρε γὰρ ὑπηλλάχθαι τινὶ τὴν ἀρίστην ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ κρᾶσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θερμότερον. οὗτος, ἄχρι μὲν οὗ πέττει τὴν θριδακίνην, ἐμψυχθήσεται καὶ συμμετρίαν κτήσεται κράσεως· ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἤδη τρέφηται, τὴν οὐσίαν αὐξήσει τῆς ἐμφύτου θερμασίας. ἐν τούτῳ δὴ καὶ μάλιστα δοκοῦσί μοι παραλογίζεσθαι σφᾶς αὐτοὺς οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν νεωτέρων ἰατρῶν, ἀγνοοῦντες, ὡς ἐνίοτε μὲν ἡ ποιότης ἐπιτείνεται τῆς ἐν ἡμῖν θερμασίας, ἐνίοτε δ’ ἡ οὐσία παραύξεται, καὶ ὡς ἑκατέρως οἱ παλαιοὶ θερμότερον γεγονέναι τὸ ζῶόν φασι. καὶ γὰρ καὶ γίνεται θερμότερον, ἄντ’ ἐπιτείνῃς αὐτοῦ τὴν θερμασίαν, ἄντ’ αὐξήσῃς τὴν οὐσίαν, ἐν ᾗ πρώτῃ περιέχεται. φέρε γὰρ εἶναι τὸ αἷμα τὸ ἐν τῷ σώματι τοῦ ζώου καθ’ αὑτὸ θερμὸν, ἢ, νὴ Δία, εἰ βούλει τὴν ξανθὴν χολὴν, ἅπαντα δὲ τἄλλα κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς ὑπάρχειν θερμὰ τῷ τούτων μετέχειν. ἆρ’ οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον ἔσται, διττῶς γίνεσθαι θερμότερον τὸ ζῶον, ἤτοι τῷ πλείονας ἐπικτήσασθαι χυμοὺς θερμοὺς, ἢ τῷ θερμοτέρους ἔχειν, ἢ πρότερον; ἐμοὶ μὲν καὶ πάνυ φαίνεται. κατὰ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν, οἶμαι, τρόπον καὶ ψυχρότερον ἔσται διττῶς, ἢ τῷ πλείους ὑποτραφῆναι τοὺς ψυχροὺς χυμοὺς, οἶον τὸ φλέγμα καὶ τὴν μέλαιναν χολὴν, ἢ τῷ, τῆς αὐτῶν ἁπάντων μενούσης συμμετρίας, ὑπαλλαχθῆναι μόνην τὴν ποιότητα. τί δὴ οὖν θαυμαστὸν, ἄχρι μὲν ἂν πέπτηται τὸ ψυχρὸν τῇ φύσει σιτίον, οἶον ἀνδράχνη τε καὶ θριδακίνη, ψυχρᾶς ποιότητος ἀναπίμπλασθαι τὸ σῶμα, πεφθέντων δ’ ἀκριβῶς καὶ γενομένων αἷμα χρηστὸν, θερμότερον αὖθις ἑαυτοῦ γίνεσθαι τὸ σῶμα τῇ τοῦ θερμοῦ χυμοῦ γενέσει; καὶ μὴν εἰ μηδὲν τούτων μήτ’ ἀδύνατόν ἐστι, μήτε θαυμαστὸν ἔτι, παυσάσθωσαν οἱ μὴ συγχωροῦντες, ἓν καὶ ταὐτὸ ἔδεσμα καὶ τὴν ὡς τροφῆς καὶ τὴν ὡς φαρμάκου χρείαν τῷ ζώῳ παρέχειν. ὡς γὰρ, εἰ καὶ μηδ’ ὅλως ἐπέφθη, διὰ παντὸς ἂν ἐφυλάχθη φάρμακον, οὕτω πεφθὲν ἄμφω γίνεται. φέρε γὰρ μηδ’ ὅλως πεφθῆναι τὴν θριδακίνην, ἢ, νὴ Δία, τὸν χυλὸν αὐτῆς, ἐπειδὴ καὶ παραπλήσια τῷ τοῦ μήκωνος ὀπῷ δρᾷ εἰς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, εἰ πάμπολυς ληφθείη, ἆρ’ οὖν φάρμακον ἔσται τηνικαῦτα μόνον, ἄλλο δ’ οὐδέν; οὐκ οἶμαί τινα περί γε τούτου ἀμφισβητήσειν. ὥστ’ ἔχει πάντως καὶ τὴν τοῦ φαρμάκου δύναμιν ἡ θριδακίνη. ἀλλὰ μὴν ἔσχε καὶ τὴν τῆς τροφῆς· ἔθρεψε γὰρ πολλάκις. ὥστ’ ἀμφοτέρας μὲν ἅμα τὰς δυνάμεις ἐν ἑαυτῇ περιέχει, δείκνυσι δ’ οὐχ ὁμοίως ἀμφοτέρας, ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὰν μὲν αὐτὴ πλέον ἐνεργῇ περὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἢ πάσχῃ, τὴν ὡς φαρμάκου μᾶλλον ἐπιδείκνυται δύναμιν· ἐπειδὰν δὲ πάσχῃ πλέον, ἢ ποιῇ, τὴν ὡς σιτίου. καὶ θαυμαστὸν οὐδὲν, εἰ τῇ θριδακίνῃ καὶ δρᾷν καὶ πάσχειν συμβέβηκεν, ὅπου γε καὶ τῷ ξίφει, καθότι καὶ μικρὸν ἔμπροσθεν ἐλέγομεν, μὴ μόνον δρᾶν εἰς τὸν κηρὸν, ἀλλὰ καὶ πάσχειν ὑπάρχει. τῷ δ’ εἶναι πολὺ πλέον ὃ πέφυκε δρᾷν, ἢ πάσχειν, λανθάνει θάτερον. ἀλλ’ εἰ σκληρότατον αὐτῷ παραβάλλοις σίδηρον, ἔμπαλίν σοι φανεῖται πάσχειν μᾶλλον, ἢ δρᾷν, καίτοι δρᾷ μέν τι καὶ τότε, παρορᾶται δ’ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ διὰ σμικρότητα. θαῤῥοῦντες οὖν ἐπὶ πάντων μὲν ἁπλῶς ἀποφαινόμεθα τῶν σιτίων, ὡς οὐ μόνον πάσχειν ὑπὸ τοῦ σώματος ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ δρᾷν εἰς αὐτὸ πέφυκεν· ἤδη δὲ καὶ περί τινων, οἷς ἐναργῶς καὶ σαφῶς ὑπάρχει τὸ δρᾷν, ὡς οὐ σιτία μόνον ἐστὶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ φάρμακα. θριδακίνη μὲν οὖν καὶ τροφὴ καὶ φάρμακον

      "openai_translation": "Pay closest attention, as I said, to distinguishing intrinsic properties from incidental ones—not only with respect to hot and cold, but no less for wet and dry. For some things of this sort, being dry in their substances, when melted by much heat take on the appearance of moisture, like bronze and iron; or else some are wet in themselves, like crystal, but when brought near untempered cold, they seem dry. Therefore one must not make judgments about all these things simply, as I remarked earlier, but always with the further scrutiny of how they stand in respect of heat or cold. For if something, though sharing in only a little heat, nevertheless still appears wet, it is such by its own nature; and if, even with abundant heating, it remains dry, it is likewise so by nature. Things that either flow with boiling heat, or are congealed by unmitigated cold, are not to be taken as wet or dry in themselves.\n\nIn this way, then, separate what is intrinsic from what is incidental, and refer your judgment to the things themselves, thus determining which are potentially hot, or cold, or dry, or wet. For potentiality should be judged not by what is incidental, but by what is intrinsic. And the common, single criterion for all is the speed of alteration. Since “hot,” “cold,” “dry,” and “wet” are said homonymously [with more than one related sense], some are so named by predominance, others because they possess the extreme of the quality from which they are named; that to which the thing under judgment readily passes, that is what it will be potentially. Thus oil is potentially hot because it easily becomes flame; the same holds for resin, asphalt, and pitch. Wine is [potentially hot] because it easily becomes blood; likewise honey, meat, and milk. These things, since they are altered in respect of their whole substances, are the food of the things that alter them. But those which both constrain and undergo alteration according to a single specific quality are only drugs; and likewise those that, remaining unchangeable in their whole substances, dispose the body—these too are drugs, but harsh and destructive to the nature of the living creature; whence, I think, their entire class is called “poison” [dēlētērion]. We must not say that such things are not, by their class, poisons simply because, when administered in an extremely small amount, they cause no perceptible harm. For then fire would not be hot, nor snow cold, since exceedingly small portions of these produce no clear effect on our bodies. For a hundredth part of a spark is, by its kind, certainly fire, yet not only would it not burn or warm us, it would not even cause any sensation when it falls on us. Likewise, a hundredth part of a drop of cold liquid would not only fail to harm or chill, it would not even produce any sensation. Do not, then, judge poisons in this way, but by their contrariety to the entire nature [of the living being], and judge this contrariety from the change that occurs through an intermediate [state]. For example, directly from the elements, neither does water change into fire, nor fire into water; rather both pass into air, and that [air] into either of the two; but into each other—not at all. The change of water into air is direct; likewise for fire. But the change of fire into water, and of water into fire, is not direct. Thus these are opposite and hostile to one another.\n\nIn the same way, the juice of the poppy [opium] is utterly opposed to the human body: it cannot act upon it in any way, either according to a single quality or, much less, according to its whole substance. This is one class of poisons. Another is that which takes from our internal heat some starting-point for change, and from there is diverted into multiform alterations, through which our nature comes to be destroyed. All such things are, by their kind, poisons—even if at times, because of their smallness, they effect nothing perceptible. Those that corrode, rot, and liquefy the nature of our body are reasonably called potentially hot; those that chill and benumb are [potentially] cold. There is nothing puzzling about the former, whether in what they themselves undergo or in what they produce in our bodies. Having approached a warm body and taken from it some inclination toward alteration, some of them arrive at extreme heat, others at putrefaction. Accordingly, they dispose the bodies of animals in conformity with their own disposition. But those that cool the body—even if you bring them warmed—cause no small perplexity as to what their nature is. For if once they have become actively hot, why do they not warm the living creature? And if they are not yet warmed, how do they appear warm? The solution to the puzzle comes if one distinguishes what is cold in itself from what is cold incidentally, as Aristotle taught. The acquired disposition of things that are hot incidentally perishes quickly, so that they readily return to their original nature. When things that are by nature cold but incidentally hot come near us, two things necessarily occur: their acquired heat is lost, while their native constitution, suffering nothing from us, remains cold. And what is remarkable about this, if the juice of the poppy, or mandrake, or hemlock, or something of that sort—even if warmed when you administer it—shortly thereafter becomes cold? Flour gruel [ptissane], milk, groats [chondros], and bread suffer the very same thing when they fall into a sick stomach and are not retained by it; often enough they are vomited up distinctly cold. And what is more, as Hippocrates noted: phlegm, though it is already a humor, and is often generated in the stomach from undigested foods, nevertheless appears cold to the touch—even when collected not only in the stomach, but drawn out of the very veins by some purgative drug. And yet it is exceedingly viscous and forcibly drawn, but even the force of the traction cannot heat it. What wonder, then, if opium, a drug so contrary to our nature, is quickly chilled even if it was warm, and chills the body along with itself? It does not retain its acquired warmth because it was by nature cold; and since its substance is not altered by us, but rather it alters and changes us, it is not warmed by us at all, and it disposes us according to itself. Being by nature cold, it surely chills us as well.\n\nTherefore there remains no longer any difficulty in the argument. Indeed, the fact that any of these things that are naturally cold, if you heat them beyond a certain point, depart from their own nature, not only removes any difficulty but also bears witness to what has been said. For just as the salamander suffers nothing from fire up to a certain point, but is burned if it is near the fire for a longer time, so too mandrake, he",

      "claude_translation": "Here is the translation of the Greek text:\n\n**Paragraph 4:**\n\nOne must pay attention, as has been said, and especially distinguish things that exist in themselves from those that exist accidentally, not only in the case of hot and cold things, but no less in the case of moist and dry things. For some such things, being dry in their substances, when melted by much heat, take on an appearance of moisture, like bronze and iron; or they are moist in themselves, like ice, but when approaching unmixed cold, they appear dry. Therefore, one must not make judgments about all these things simply, as we were saying earlier, but along with considering how they stand in relation to heat or cold. For if things appear moist while partaking of little heat, they are such by their own nature; and if they appear dry despite abundant heat, [they are dry by nature]. But things either flowing with boiling heat or congealed through unmixed cold should not be considered moist or dry in themselves. In this way, then, one should distinguish things that exist in themselves from those that exist accidentally, and referring to these very things, thus make judgments about things potentially hot, cold, dry, or moist. For one must judge what is potential not in relation to the accidental, but in relation to what exists in itself.\n\nThe common and single criterion for all is the speed of alteration. Since \"hot,\" \"cold,\" \"dry,\" and \"moist\" are spoken of homonymously—for some things are named thus by predominance, others as having the extreme of the quality from which they are named—into whichever of these the thing being judged readily changes, it will be potentially of that nature. For oil is potentially hot because it easily becomes flame. Similarly also resin, asphalt, and pitch. Wine [is potentially hot] because it easily becomes blood. Similarly also honey, meat, and milk. These things, then, being altered in their whole substances, become nourishment for the things that alter them. But things that undergo alteration and change in any single quality are medicines only, just as things that remain unchanged in their whole substances while affecting the body are also medicines; but these are harsh and destructive to the animal's nature. Hence, I think, their entire class is called poisonous.\n\nFor one should not say that such things are not poisonous by nature just because when administered in extremely small amounts they cause no perceptible harm. For in this way neither would fire be hot nor snow cold; for extremely small amounts of these too produce no clear effect on our bodies. For a hundredth part of a single spark is certainly fire by nature, but it would not only not burn or warm us, but would not even provide any sensation when it strikes us. Similarly, a hundredth part of a cold droplet would not only cause no harm or cooling, but would not even provide any sensation. Therefore, one should not judge poisons in this way either, but by their opposition to the whole nature, and judge the opposition from intermediate change.\n\nFor example, from the elements themselves, neither water naturally changes into fire nor fire into water, but both into air, and that into each of them, but these in no way into each other. The change of water into air is immediate; likewise that of fire. But the change of fire and water into each other is not immediate. These, therefore, are opposite and hostile to each other. In the same way, poppy juice is completely opposite to the human body, being unable to act upon it either in any single quality or much less in its whole substance. This, then, is one class of poisons. Another consists of those that take some starting point of change from the heat within us, but from there turn to manifold alterations, by which our nature happens to be destroyed. For all such things are poisons by nature, even if sometimes due to their small amount they produce no perceptible effect.\n\nThings that corrode, putrefy, and dissolve our body's nature are reasonably called potentially hot; those that cool and numb, cold. The former seem to undergo and produce in our bodies nothing contrary to reason. For approaching a hot body and taking from it some impulse toward alteration, some reach extreme heat, others putrefaction. They therefore reasonably affect animals' bodies according to their own condition. But things that cool the body, even if you apply them heated, create no small difficulty about what their nature might be. For if they have once become actually hot, why do they not warm the animal? Or if they are not yet warmed, how do they appear hot?\n\nThe solution to this difficulty is if one distinguishes what is cold in itself from what is accidentally cold, as Aristotle taught. For the acquired condition of accidentally hot things is quickly destroyed, so that they easily return to their original nature. When things naturally cold but accidentally hot approach us, two things necessarily happen: their acquired heat is destroyed, and their own mixture, suffering nothing from ours, remains cold. And what is surprising if poppy juice, mandrake, hemlock, or something of the sort, even if you apply them heated, become cold shortly after? The same thing happens to barley gruel, milk, wheat porridge, and bread when they fall into a weak stomach and are not mastered by it; for they are often vomited quite cold. And what is greater than this, which Hippocrates also noted: although phlegm is already a humor, often generated in the stomach from undigested foods, nevertheless it feels cold to the touch, not only when collected in the stomach, but even when drawn from the veins themselves by some purging medicine. And although it is extremely viscous and is drawn out violently, nevertheless not even the violence of the extraction can warm it.\n\nWhat is surprising, then, if poppy juice, a medicine so contrary to our nature, immediately cools down even if drunk hot, and cools the body along with itself? For it does not preserve its acquired heat because it was naturally cold; and by its substance not being altered by us, but rather altering and changing us, it is neither warmed by us, and it affects us according to itself; being naturally cold, it certainly cools us too. Therefore, nothing difficult remains in the argument. For indeed, the fact that all these naturally cold things, if you heat them excessively, depart from their own nature, not only presents no difficulty, but even testifies to what has been said. For just as the salamander suffers nothing from fire up to a point, but is burned if it approaches fire for a longer time, so also mandrake, hemlock, and fleawort, having brief contact with fire, still preserve their own mixture, but when heated more, are immediately destroyed and can no longer do any of what they naturally could before.\n\nThe nature of all such things is most contrary to humans; and when I say nature, I mean the whole substance and mixture from the primary elements, hot and cold, dry and moist; while that of things that nourish most quickly is most akin. All other things are between these, some more, others less able to act upon and be affected by our body. For castoreum and pepper are able to act upon rather than be affected by our body; while wine, honey, and barley gruel [are able] to be affected rather than to act. All these things, therefore, both are affected by and act upon the body. For generally, when things come together and fight and contend with each other about alteration over a longer time, it is necessary for each of them to act and be affected. Perhaps even if this doesn't happen over a very long time, the thing being overcome still acts upon the victor, but so slightly as to escape sensation. For even the sharpest iron, if it cuts the softest wax throughout day and night, cannot avoid becoming clearly blunt. Thus indeed that saying seems well put: \"A drop of water hollows rock with persistence.\" For this is seen to happen thus. But in one or two impacts, nothing clear can yet be seen in such cases.\n\nHence, I think, some have believed that certain things are not affected at all by what they encounter; and we must concede to those who speak thus. Often we ourselves must speak similarly to them about most things, except when we might carry the argument to ultimate precision, as we are doing at present. Thus the doctrine of constant affection [aeipatheias], for those examining it by reason alone, has strong demonstration. However, there is no use for it in particular practices. For if there are always such small affections about us as to produce no perceptible and clear harm to any function, they are certainly contemptible, and we must concede to one who says such things are nothing.\n\nThis is how it is with almost all nourishing things. For these too produce some effect on human bodies, but nothing perceptible or clearly evident at once. However, their prolonged administration greatly alters and clearly changes bodies. Some indeed immediately show alteration clearly even at first use, like lettuce, which clearly cools those with burning stomachs and makes them thirstless, but clearly harms those who are chilled. It contributes considerably to sleep, for no other reason than that it is cold and moist in temperament;",

      "gemini_translation": "Here is the translation of the provided Ancient Greek paragraph.\n\n**Paragraph 4:**\n\nOne must pay attention, as has been said, and distinguish above all the essential properties from the accidental ones, not only in the case of hot and cold things, but no less so for wet and dry things. For some such things, being dry in their substances, when melted by great heat, have taken on the appearance of wetness, such as bronze and iron; or they are essentially wet, like rock-crystal, but when they encounter extreme cold, they appear dry. Therefore, one must make the judgment of all these things not simply, as we also said in the preceding sections, but by considering along with it how they stand in regard to heat or cold. For if things appear wet even when they possess little heat, they are such by their own nature; and likewise, if they appear dry even with abundant heat, [they are dry by nature]. But things that are either flowing with boiling heat, or are solidified by extreme cold, one must not consider to be, in the one case, essentially wet, or in the other, essentially dry. By this method, then, one should separate the essential from the accidental, and by referring to these very principles, one should thus make a judgment of things that are potentially hot, or cold, or dry, or wet. For a thing's potential must be judged not by its accidental property, but by its essential one. And the common and single criterion for all of them is the speed of their alteration.\n\nSince ‘hot’, ‘cold’, ‘dry’, and ‘wet’ are spoken of homonymously [i.e., in several senses]—for some things are so named by predominance, others because they possess an extreme degree of the quality from which they are derivatively named—into whichever of these the thing being judged readily changes, it will be potentially of that kind. For oil is potentially hot, because it easily becomes flame. In the same way, so are resin, asphalt, and pitch. And wine, because it easily becomes blood. In the same way, so are honey, meat, and milk. These things, then, being altered in their entire substances, are foods for the things that alter them. But those that undergo and produce alteration according to some single quality are only medicines, as are also those which, while remaining unchangeable in their own entire substances, affect the body. These too are medicines, but they are harsh and destructive to the nature of the animal; for which reason, I believe, their entire class is called poisonous [deleterious]. For surely one should not say that such things are not by class poisonous just because, when administered in absolutely minute quantities, they produce no perceptible harm at all. For on that reasoning, fire would not be hot, nor snow cold, since it is clear that utterly tiny amounts of these produce no distinct effect upon our bodies. For a hundredth part of a single spark is certainly fire by class, but not only would it not burn or warm us, it would not even provide any sensation upon contact. And so too, a hundredth part of a cold droplet would not only do no harm or cool us, it would not even provide any sensation. Let us not, therefore, judge poisons in this way either, but by their opposition to our whole nature; and let us judge this opposition by the mediated nature of their transformation. For instance, from among the elements, water is not constituted by nature to change into fire, nor fire into water; rather, both change into air, and air into either of them, but they in no way change into each other. The change of water into air is therefore direct, as is that of fire. But the change of fire and water into each other is not direct. These, then, are opposite and hostile to one another. In the same way, poppy juice is completely opposite to the human body, being able to effect nothing in it either according to a single quality or, much less still, in its whole substance. This, then, is one class of poisons.\n\nAnother class consists of those that receive some starting-point of change from the heat within us, but from there are diverted into manifold alterations, by which our nature happens to be destroyed. For all such things are poisonous by class, even if, on account of their smallness, they sometimes produce no perceptible effect. Now, things that corrode, putrefy, and dissolve the nature of our body are reasonably called potentially hot; while those, in turn, that cool and numb it are called cold. Concerning the former, it seems in no way paradoxical what they either suffer themselves or inflict upon our bodies. For when they come near a warm body and receive from it some impetus for alteration, some arrive at an extreme of heat, others at putrefaction. It is reasonable, then, that they affect the bodies of animals according to their own disposition. But as for those that cool the body, even if you apply them after heating them, they present no small puzzle as to what their nature might be. For if they have once become actually hot, why do they not warm the animal? Or if they have not yet been warmed, how do they appear hot? The solution to the puzzle is to distinguish the essentially cold from the accidentally cold, as Aristotle taught. For in things that are accidentally hot, the acquired disposition is quickly destroyed, so that they easily return to their original nature. And when things that are by nature cold but accidentally hot come into contact with us, two things necessarily happen: their acquired heat is destroyed, while their own temperament, suffering nothing from ours, remains cold. And what is surprising if poppy juice, or mandrake, or hemlock, or any such thing, even if you apply it heated, becomes cold a short while later? Barley-gruel, milk, groats, and bread suffer this very same thing when, having entered a sick stomach, they are not mastered by it; at any rate, they are often vomited up quite cold. And what is more significant than this is something Hippocrates also noted: phlegm, though it is already a humor and is often generated in the stomach from undigested foods, nevertheless appears cold to the touch, not only when it has formed in the stomach, but even when drawn from the very veins by some purging medicine. And yet it is extremely viscous and is drawn out by force, but still not even the violence of its extraction is able to heat it. What wonder is it, then, if poppy juice, a medicine so contrary to our nature, is cooled very quickly, even if drunk hot, and cools the body along with itself? For it does not retain its acquired heat, because it was by nature cold; and because its substance is not altered by us, but rather it alters and changes us, it is neither heated at all by us, and it itself affects us according to its own nature. Being, therefore, cold by nature, it surely cools us too. Consequently, no puzzle remains in this account.\n\nIndeed, the fact that if you heat any of these naturally cold things too much, it departs from its own nature, not only contains nothing puzzling but even bears witness to what has been said. For just as the salamander is for a time unaffected by fire, but is burnt up if it remains near the fire for a longer time, so too mandrake, hemlock, and psyllium, when they have been in contact with fire for a short while, still preserve their own temperament; but when heated for longer, they are immediately destroyed and are no longer able to do any of the things they were naturally constituted to do. The nature of all such things, then, is most contrary to humans—and when I say ‘nature’, I mean the entire substance and temperament [krasis] which comes from the primary elements: hot, cold, dry, and wet. But the nature of things that are most quickly nourishing is most akin to us. All other things are between these two extremes, some being more able to act upon and be acted upon by our body, and others less so. For castoreum and pepper are more able to act upon our body than be acted upon by it; whereas wine, honey, and barley-gruel are more able to be acted upon than to act. All these things, therefore, both are acted upon in some way and act upon the body. For in general, whenever things come together and contend and strive with one another over alteration for a considerable time, it is necessary for each of them to both act and be acted upon. And perhaps, even if this does not happen over a very long time, the thing being overcome still acts upon the thing that masters it, but so slightly as to escape perception. For not even the sharpest iron, if it cuts the softest wax for a whole day and night, can possibly avoid becoming perceptibly blunted. Thus, that saying also seems to have been well put: \"A drop of water hollows a stone by persistence.\" For this is indeed seen to happen. But after a single or even a second impact, it is not yet possible to see anything clear in such cases. For this reason, I think, it has seemed to some that certain things are not affected at all by those they come into contact with; and one must concede to those who say so. And often we ourselves must speak in the same way as they do on most matters, except whenever we are elevating the discussion to the highest degree of precision, as we are doing at present. Thus, the doctrine of universal affection [that everything is always affected], for those who examine it by reason alone, has a strong proof. However, there is no need for it in particular practical applications. For if there are effects upon us that are always so small as to produce no perceptible and clear harm to any function, they are surely contemptible, and one must concede to the person who says such things are nothing.\n\nThis is also the case with, one might almost say, all foods. For these too produce some effect on the bodies of humans, but it is not perceptible, nor at all distinct. Their long-continued use, however, greatly alters and clearly changes our bodies. Some, indeed, show the alteration plainly right from their first use, such as lettuce, which clearly cools and quenches the thirst of those with an inflamed stomach, but clearly harms those who are chilled. It also contributes no small amount to sleep, for no other reason than that it is cold and wet in its temperament. But it is wet and cold in relation to a human being and to other things it is constituted to nourish in the same way that green wood is in relation to fire. Consequently, both properties reasonably belong to such foodstuffs: that of affecting our bodies like medicines, and that of nourishing them. Throughout the entire time of digestion, they act as medicines; but when they are now nourishing and being completely assimilated, they no longer act against us in any way, but increase the innate heat, as was said before. For this is now a common property of all nourishing things, and one should not be surprised if something, before it is assimilated and provides nourishment, cooled while still being digested, but once assimilated and having nourished, it warmed. We must always remember the example of the green wood. Thus, the use of all such things for physicians is twofold: both as foods and as medicines. For let us suppose that someone’s optimal temperament in the stomach has been altered toward the hotter. This person, for as long as he is digesting the lettuce, will be cooled and will acquire a balanced temperament; but when he is now being nourished from it, he will increase the substance of his innate heat.\n\nIt is in this very matter, I think, that most of the younger physicians delude themselves, ignorant that sometimes the *quality* of our innate heat is intensified, while at other times its *substance* is increased, and that the ancients say the animal has become hotter in either case. For it does become hotter, whether you intensify its heat or you increase the substance in which that heat is primarily contained. For let us suppose that the blood in the animal’s body is hot in itself—or, by Zeus, the yellow bile, if you prefer—and that all other things are accidentally hot by partaking of these. Will it not then be necessary for the animal to become hotter in two ways: either by acquiring more hot humors, or by having them be hotter than before? To me, this seems absolutely clear. And in the same way, I think, it will become colder in two ways: either by the cold humors being under-nourished—such as phlegm and black bile—or by only the quality being altered while the proportion of all of them remains the same. What wonder is it, then, that as long as a naturally cold food, such as purslane and lettuce, is being digested, the body is filled with a cold quality, but when these have been precisely digested and have become good blood, the body in turn becomes hotter than itself through the generation of a hot humor?\n\nAnd surely, if none of these things is either impossible or any longer surprising, let those people cease who do not concede that one and the same foodstuff provides the animal with the use of both a food and a medicine. For just as, if it were not digested at all, it would have been preserved as a medicine throughout, so when it is digested it becomes both. For let us suppose that the lettuce is not digested at all—or, by Zeus, its juice, since if a very large amount is taken, it acts on a human in a way similar to poppy juice—will it not then be only a medicine, and nothing else? I do not think anyone will dispute this point. So, lettuce certainly possesses the power of a medicine. But it has also possessed that of a food, for it has often nourished. Therefore, it contains both powers within itself, but it does not display both in the same way. Rather, when it itself acts more upon the person than it is acted upon, it displays more the power of a medicine; but when it is acted upon more than it acts, it displays that of a food. And it is not at all surprising that it is the lot of lettuce to both act and be acted upon, when, as we said a little earlier, even a sword is subject not only to acting on the wax but also to being acted upon. But because what it is constituted to do is so much greater than what it is constituted to suffer, the latter escapes notice. But if you were to set it against the hardest iron, it will appear to you, on the contrary, to be acted upon more than it acts, although it does act somewhat even then, but its power is overlooked on account of its smallness.\n\nWith confidence, therefore, we declare simply of all foods that they are constituted not only to be acted upon by our body, but also to act upon it. And now we also declare of certain foods, in which this action is manifest and clear, that they are not only foods but also medicines. Lettuce, then, is both a food and a cold medicine; rocket is both a food and a hot medicine. And if castoreum is digested over time, it too would be at once a food and a hot medicine. And so too with mustard, and pepper, and of the herbs, dill and rue, oregano and pennyroyal, and calamint, savory, and thyme. For all these are both foods and hot medicines. For before they are transformed into blood, while they are still being digested, they are medicines; but once transformed, they are no longer medicines, but are now foods—according to the second meaning of ‘food’, of course, which is not yet nourishment, but is *like* nourishment. So, just as we posited earlier in the case of lettuce one stomach colder than it should be and another hotter, so now let the two stomachs be posited for all potentially hot things. The one that is colder than it should be, for as long as all such things are contained within it and are being digested, it will warm and restore to a balanced temperament and will benefit it in the manner of medicines; but the other, the hot one, it will inflame and greatly harm. And it will produce these alterations according to quality. But once they are precisely digested, transformed, and have become good blood, they will increase the animal’s innate heat according to substance, not according to quality. For in general, whether a food is potentially cold or hot, once it has been turned into blood, it will increase the innate heat in the same way; but as long as it is being led toward the form of blood, but has not yet been completely turned into blood, it cools and heats the body in the manner of a medicine.\n\nThis entire account has depended on a single principle. For this reason, one must always preserve it and remember it throughout: that each body possesses a certain particularity of temperament, which is akin to this specific nature but different from that one; and that, if it alters the foreign thing into its own nature, it will thus increase the substance of the heat within it; but if it is altered, one of two things will happen to it: if the thing changing it is warming, it will acquire some heat; if it is not warming, it will lose its own. It is clear from these two points, then, that all such things are relative. For in relation to the particularity of the altering nature, each of the things administered will have the status of a food, or a medicine, or both. For example, hemlock is food for the starling, but a poison for a human; and hellebore is food for quail, but a medicine for humans. For the temperament of quails is able to assimilate hellebore to itself, but that of humans is not.",

      "openai_translation": "It has already become clear, then, that the judgment of things that are, relative to us, moist, or dry, or cold, or hot, would most accurately be made not from anything external, but from those [effects] which we ourselves experience; and that this, first and most of all, should be the point of examination, and afterwards, if there should be any need, also the external [signs]. For if the activity of the drug applied is manifest and clear to sense, one must trust this, neglecting all other marks; but if [the activity] is dim and unclear or mixed, or has any sort of ambiguity at all, then it must be judged also by reference to all the external [criteria].\n\nNot even for these [external criteria], however, should we look far afield, but [take them] from the very essence of the thing sought. For instance, if oil is hot, the point is not that it is viscous, or pale, or light, but whether it is readily ignited; for this is what it is for it to be hot in power [i.e., by inherent capacity], that it quickly passes over into being hot in actuality. And in the same way with our bodies: not whether [something] is thick-textured or fine-textured, moist or light, viscous or pale, but whether, when applied, it warms. Thus, not even [is it decisive] if it is sweet, or loosens the belly, or makes bloodletting flow readily when the blood is made to drip. For even these things are superfluous, given that what is at hand to consider is whether, when applied, it warms.\n\nIf, then, it did this conspicuously and strongly, like pepper, it would be evident to all and beyond dispute. But since it does not [do so] strongly, it reasonably becomes a matter of inquiry. Much more is there perplexity and dispute among physicians concerning rose [preparation] and vinegar, whether by power they are naturally hot or cold. We must therefore discover some precise and clear definitions that belong, in the case of all things said to be [hot or cold] in power, to hot or to cold, to dry or to moist, just as previously we established them in the case of things said to be [such] in actuality. And, I think, it is fitting to begin from the most evident; for once one has exercised oneself on these, one will follow the less clear more easily.\n\nStraightaway, then, in applying some drug or food to the body, let the thing applied be free from all violent acquired heat and cold. For the definition we made earlier, when we attempted to distinguish moist and dry bodies, would be no less useful now for things hot and cold in power. For whether you clearly warm what is applied that is cold in power, or cool what is hot, the first impact upon the body will produce sensation from the acquired condition, not from the proper mixture [i.e., inherent temperament] of the thing applied. Therefore, in order that the nature of the thing applied may be examined accurately and without admixture, let it be lukewarm to the utmost degree possible, having received no notable external alteration of intense heat or cold. Such, then, should be the first preparation of the drug to be applied.\n\nAnd let it not be applied to every bodily condition when you are testing its power, but to the simplest and most extreme [conditions] possible. If, then, when applied to an extremely hot condition it produces a sensation of cold, it would thus be cold. Likewise, if when applied to a cold one it appears immediately hot, this too would be hot. But if it appears hot to a hot condition, or cold to a cold condition, do not absolutely pronounce the one hot and the other cold. For sometimes the condition is hot to the extreme, while the drug is moderately cold; it has not altered [the condition], and moreover, having cooled and condensed the whole outer surface, it has shut [the heat] within and prevented it from evaporating, and thereby inflamed the condition even more. Thus too, even if what is applied brings no heat at all to a cold condition, consider whether something moderately hot, being applied to a condition that needs extreme heat, has simply done nothing.\n\nAccordingly, one must not test the powers of the drugs applied in such a way, nor if anything acts by accident and not according to itself [i.e., by its own nature]. The criterion of what acts by accident is both the condition and the time. The condition, if it is simple and single; the criterion by time is determined as follows. What is seen clearly to cool or heat at the very moment of application would surely be such according to itself and by itself; but what [produces the effect] in the course of time may be led to it from some accidental circumstance, as when in tetanus, in the height of summer, in a young, well-fleshed person, a copious dashing of cold water produces a recall of heat. But that cold water does not heat by itself is evident from the first impact: for it produces a sensation of cold, and indeed it cools the skin as long as it is being poured on, and it does not provide the warming either for all bodies or during the pouring, but only in well-fleshed youths, in the middle of summer, after one stops the dashing. Just as, then, if there were any time, or nature of body, or condition in which cold water immediately upon falling produced a sensation of heat, it would rightly be inquired whether by itself it is naturally disposed to heat or to cool; so now, since all animate and inanimate things alike are seen to be cooled at once and continuously, and in those who have an inborn warmth and, as it were, a spring of fire in the viscera, if it is applied to them, it sometimes produces a certain recall of heat, I think it reasonable to say that in such cases it heats incidentally, not by itself. And indeed it is evident how. For by condensing the outer surface and shutting off [the pores], it causes the return of the warmth from the depth: partly because [the heat] is gathered by not evaporating, partly because it retreats inward under the force of the surrounding cold, and partly because it is nourished by the humors there. When, then, having been both gathered and nourished, it rushes more forcefully toward the surface, there is a recall of heat, and an indication that the cold water has not increased the warmth by itself. For by itself it cooled the skin; and from its cooling there followed at once both a condensation and a retreat of the heat into the depth. Of these effects, the condensation produced a hindrance of perspiration, and the retreat into the depth brought about a working-up of the humors there. Of these, the hindrance of perspiration produced an accumulation of warmth, and the working-up of the humors produced its generation. And to each of these in turn there follows an increase of the innate warmth. Thus, by means of these intermediates, the cold sometimes produces an increase of the animal’s internal warmth, but never by itself.\n\nAnd indeed the hot sometimes cools incidentally through the intermediate of evacuation, as a fomentation relieves an inflammation. Since an inflammation comes about through a hot flux, its proper remedy is the evacuation of the excess; and what necessarily follows evacuation is the cooling of the part that has been heated by the inflammation. Since, then, there are two conditions in inflamed bodies—so far as concerns the excess of superfluity, a departure from what is natural in respect of quantity, and so far as concerns the heat, a departure in respect of quality—the cure of the one of the conditions carries along with it the other as well. And thus incidentally the drugs that evacuate hot matter and the inflammation of the parts become cooling.\n\nThese points, then, must be distinguished, and one must try, according to the quantity of the simple condition, to discover the quantity of the drug’s power: for example, if the condition is at the extreme of heat, the drug should be extremely cold; if the condition falls a little short of the extreme, the drug too should fall a little short; and if the condition is further removed from the utmost heat, the drug should be proportionally removed from the utmost cold. For if you were to make the beginning of your examination from such estimation, you would more quickly discover the proper power of each [drug]. In general, if some drug applied to a body with a single simple affection of heat, at once, upon the first application, brought a sensation of cold, that drug is cold in power—much more so if it remains such after the first application for all subsequent time. And if it even completely cures the hot condition, it is of necessity cold. It must always be applied lukewarm when it is being tested, as has been said already. But once it has been recognized that it",

      "claude_translation": "**Translation of Paragraph 5:**\n\nIt has now become clear that the judgment of things as moist or dry, cold or hot in relation to us would be made accurately not from some external source, but from what we ourselves experience. And this should be examined first and foremost, and subsequently, if necessary, also the external evidence. For if the effect of an applied drug is evident and clear to sensation, this should be trusted, disregarding all other indicators. But if it is faint and unclear, or mixed, or has any ambiguity whatsoever, then it should be judged in relation to all external factors. And not even in relation to these from afar, but from the very substance of what is being investigated—for instance, if oil is hot, not because it is viscous or pale or light, but because it easily ignites; for this is what it means for it to be hot in potentiality: to quickly change into what is actually hot.\n\nIn the same way with our bodies, not whether something is thick-parted or fine-parted, or moist, or light, or viscous, or pale, but whether it heats when applied. Similarly, not whether it is sweet and moves the bowels, or makes the blood flow well in bloodletting when it drips on it. For these too are superfluous, when one can examine whether it heats when applied. If it did this noticeably and strongly, like pepper, it would be obvious to all and undisputed. But since it doesn't do so strongly, it reasonably becomes a matter of investigation.\n\nMuch more has there been puzzlement and dispute among physicians about rose oil and vinegar, whether they are naturally hot or cold in potentiality. One must therefore discover certain precise and clear distinctions for all things said to be potentially hot or cold, dry or moist, as we did earlier for things said to be so in actuality. It is fitting, I think, to begin from the most evident cases; for having been trained in these, one will more easily follow the less clear ones.\n\nSo immediately when applying some drug or food to the body, let what is being applied be free from all intense acquired heat or cooling. For the distinction we made earlier, when we attempted to diagnose moist and dry bodies, would be no less useful now for things potentially hot and cold. For whether you clearly heat something that is potentially cold when applied, or cool something hot, the body's first contact will produce sensation from the acquired condition, not from the proper temperament of what was applied.\n\nSo that the nature of what is being applied may be examined accurately and purely, let it be as lukewarm as possible, having received no notable external alteration of either intense heat or cooling. Let this be the first preparation of the drug being applied. But let it not be applied to every bodily condition when you examine its power, but to conditions as simple and pure as possible.\n\nIf when applied to an extremely hot condition it produces a sensation of cooling, it would thus be cold. Similarly, if it appears immediately hot to a cold condition, this too would be hot. But if it appears hot to a hot condition, or cold to a cold one, do not immediately declare one hot and the other cold. For sometimes the condition is extremely hot, but the drug is moderately cold—it hasn't altered it, and moreover by cooling and condensing the entire external surface, it has shut the heat inside and prevented it from being transpired, and from this has increased the inflammation of the condition.\n\nSimilarly, even if what is applied brings no heat to a cold condition, consider whether being moderately hot it had no effect on a condition requiring extreme heat. Therefore, the powers of applied drugs should not be tested in this way, nor if they produce something incidentally and not in themselves. The judgment of what is incidental depends on the condition and the time. The condition, if it is simple and single; and the judgment by time is distinguished as follows.\n\nWhat appears clearly to cool or heat immediately upon being applied would surely be such both in itself and through itself. But what does so over time might perhaps be brought to this from some incidental cause, just as in tetanus, in midsummer, for a young well-fleshed person, a copious dousing with cold water produces a recall of heat. But that cold water does not heat in itself is clear from the first contact; for it produces a sensation of cooling, and indeed cools the skin as long as it is being poured on it, and provides warmth neither in all bodies nor during the pouring, but only in well-fleshed young people, in midsummer, after one stops pouring.\n\nJust as cold water immediately cools whatever it strikes, whether animate or inanimate bodies, whether hot or cold, in the same way, if there were a time, or nature of body, or condition in which cold water brought a sensation of heat immediately upon contact, it would reasonably be investigated whether it naturally heats or cools in itself. But now, since all things both animate and inanimate are seen to be cooled immediately and throughout, while for those that have innate heat and a kind of source of fire in their organs, if it is applied to these, it sometimes produces a recall of heat—I think it is reasonable that it heats them incidentally, not in itself.\n\nAnd indeed it appears how: for by condensing the external surface and shutting in the heat, it produces the return of warmth from the depths, which is simultaneously collected by not being transpired, simultaneously withdrawing to the depths due to the force of the surrounding cold, and simultaneously being nourished by the humors there. For when, having been collected and nourished, it rushes more vigorously to the surface, there is a recall of heat, but this is an indication that the cold water did not increase the warmth in itself.\n\nFor in itself it cooled the skin; but condensation followed its cooling along with withdrawal of heat to the depths; of these, the condensation prevented transpiration, while the withdrawal to the depths worked on the humors there. The prevention of transpiration produced collection of heat, while the working of the humors produced its generation. The increase of innate heat follows each of these. So through both intermediaries, cold sometimes produces an increase of heat in the animal, but never in itself.\n\nAnd indeed heat too sometimes cools incidentally through the intermediary of evacuation, as a fomentation does to inflammation. For since inflammation occurs from a hot flux, its proper cure is evacuation of the excess, and what necessarily follows evacuation is the cooling of the part heated by the inflammation. Since there is a double condition in inflamed bodies—insofar as there is excess of the superfluous, they depart from the natural state in quantity, and insofar as there is heat, in quality—the cure of one condition has the other following it. And drugs that evacuate hot matter become incidentally cooling of the inflammation of the parts.\n\nThese things must be distinguished, and one must try to discover the degree of the drug's power according to the degree of the simple condition. For instance, if the condition is extremely hot, the drug should be extremely cold; if the condition falls a little short of the extreme, the drug too should fall a little short; and if the condition is further from extreme heat, the drug should be proportionally distant from extreme cold. For if you make the beginning of their examination from such estimation, you would more quickly discover the proper power of each.\n\nIn general, if any drug whatsoever applied to any simple hot condition immediately upon first application brought a sensation of cooling, that is cold in power, and much more so if it remains such even after the first application throughout. And if it completely cures the hot condition, it is necessarily cold. But it must always be applied lukewarm when being tested, as was said before. Once recognized as such, when then taken up for treatment, it is better to take it cold, unless the drug is extremely cold but the disease is not extremely hot.\n\nThese matters will be discussed more extensively both in the works on drugs and in the writings on therapeutic method. But for the present, one must know this much: that if any drug applied to a hot and simple condition immediately and throughout all subsequent time brought both the sensation of cooling to the patient and comfort and benefit, this is necessarily cold, even if it sometimes appears hot in other cases. For when examined accurately in those cases, it will be found not to heat in itself, but incidentally.\n\nWhen we say \"in itself\" or \"primarily\" or \"through no intermediary,\" the same thing is indicated by all these expressions. We will provide practice in all these together with appropriate examples in the treatises on drugs.",

      "gemini_translation": "**Paragraph 5:**\n\nIt has therefore now become clear that the discernment of things that are wet, or dry, or cold, or hot in relation to us would be made accurately not from some external source, but from what we ourselves experience, and that one must consider this method first and foremost, and then, if need be, the external one as well. For if the effect [ἐνέργεια] of the administered drug were evident and clear to the senses, one must trust this, disregarding all other indicators; but if it is faint, unclear, mixed, or has any ambiguity at all, then it must also be judged by all the external factors. Therefore, one should not judge even by these external factors from a distance, but from the very substance [οὐσία] of the thing under investigation. For example, whether oil is hot is determined not because it is viscous, or pale, or light, but if it readily bursts into flame. For this is what it means for it to be hot in potentiality [δυνάμει]: to change quickly into what is hot in actuality [ἐνεργείᾳ]. And in the same way also in the case of our bodies, the test is not whether a substance is thick-particled, or thin-particled, or moist, or light, or viscous, or pale, but whether it heats when administered. Thus, it is also not a matter of whether it is sweet, or moves the bowels, or makes the blood flow easily in phlebotomies if it is dripped on the wound. For these things too are superfluous, when it is possible to observe whether it heats when administered. If, then, it did this in a marked and strong manner, as pepper does, it would be manifest and indisputable to all; but since it does not do so strongly, it reasonably becomes a matter of inquiry. The question has been raised with much more perplexity and dispute among physicians concerning rose oil and vinegar, whether they are by nature hot or cold in potentiality.\n\nIt is necessary, therefore, to discover for all things said to be potentially hot, or cold, or dry, or moist, some precise and clear definitions, just as we did before for things said to be so in actuality. And it is fitting, I think, to make our beginning from the most evident cases; for once a person is practiced in these, he will more easily follow along in the less clear cases. Right away, then, in applying this or that drug or food to the body, let the administered substance be rid of all intense acquired heat and cold. For the definition we made previously, when we undertook to distinguish moist and dry bodies, would be no less useful now in the case of things that are potentially hot and cold. For whether you clearly heat a substance that is potentially cold when you apply it, or cool one that is hot, the body’s first contact will produce a sensation from the acquired disposition, not from the inherent temperament of the administered substance. In order, then, that the nature of the administered substance may be examined accurately and purely, let it be as lukewarm as possible, having acquired no marked external alteration of either intense heat or cold. Let this, then, be the first preparation of the drug to be administered. And it should be administered not to a body in just any disposition, when you are examining its power, but to those in the simplest and most extreme states possible. If, then, when administered to a disposition that is extremely hot, it should produce a sensation of cooling, it would in this way be cold. Likewise, if to a cold disposition it should immediately appear hot, this too would be hot. But if it should appear hot to a hot disposition, or cold to a cold one, one must not in every case declare the one hot and the other cold. For sometimes the disposition is extremely hot, but the drug is moderately cold; it has not altered the disposition, and furthermore, by cooling and constricting the entire outer surface, it has shut the heat inside and prevented it from being breathed out, and from this has inflamed the disposition even more. In this way, too, even if the administered substance brings no heat to a cold disposition, one must consider whether, being moderately hot, it did nothing to a disposition that required extreme heat.\n\nTherefore, one must neither test the powers of administered drugs in this way, nor if they produce some effect accidentally [κατὰ συμβεβηκός] and not in themselves [καθ’ αὑτό]. The criteria for what is accidental are the disposition and the time. The disposition, if it is simple and single; and the judgment by time is determined as follows. That which is seen to cool or heat clearly at the very moment of its application would surely be of such a nature in and through itself; but that which does so over time might perhaps be led to this effect by some accident, just as, in the case of tetanus, in the middle of summer, on a young, fleshy person, a great dousing of cold water brings about a recall of heat. But that cold water does not heat in itself is clear from the first contact; for it produces a sensation of cooling, and indeed it cools the skin for as long as it is poured on it, and it does not produce this heating effect on all bodies, nor while it is being poured, but only on young, fleshy people, in the middle of summer, after one has stopped pouring. Just as, therefore, the cold water cools on the spot those things upon which it falls, whether they be animate or inanimate bodies, and whether they be hot or cold, in the same way, if there were some time, or nature of body, or disposition, in which the cold water brought a sensation of heat immediately upon contact, it would reasonably be questioned whether its nature is to heat or to cool in itself. But as it is, since all things, both animate and inanimate, are seen to be cooled on the spot and continuously, while for those things that have an innate heat and a sort of fount of fire in their inward parts, if it is applied to them, it sometimes produces a recall of heat, it is reasonable, I think, that it heats such things by some accident, not in itself. And indeed, it is apparent how. For by the constriction of the outer surface and the shutting in of the heat, it causes the return of the warmth from the depths, which is at once collected by not being breathed out, and at the same time retreats to the depths because of the force of the surrounding cold, and is also nourished by the humors there. For when, having been collected and nourished, it rushes more forcefully toward the surface, a recall of heat occurs, which is an indication that the cold water did not increase the heat in itself. For in itself it cooled the skin; and upon its cooling, there followed both a constriction and a retreat of the heat into the depths; and of these, the constriction caused a prevention of exhalation, while the retreat into the depths caused a concoction of the humors there. The prevention of exhalation produced the collection of heat, while the concoction of the humors produced its generation. And upon both of these, in turn, follows the increase of the innate heat. Therefore, through both of these intermediaries, the cold sometimes produces an increase of the heat in the animal, but never in itself.\n\nAnd yet, the hot also sometimes cools accidentally, through the medium of evacuation, as a poultice does for an inflammation. For since inflammation comes about from a hot flux, its proper cure is the evacuation of the excess, and what in every case follows evacuation is the cooling of the part that was heated due to the inflammation. Since, therefore, there is a twofold disposition in inflamed bodies—insofar as they deviate from the natural in quantity on account of the excess of superfluity, and in quality on account of the heat—the cure of one of the dispositions has the other following it. And so it happens that drugs that evacuate hot matter also accidentally become cooling agents for the inflammation of the parts. One must, therefore, define these things, and try to discover the quantity of the drug’s power according to the quantity of the simple disposition; for instance, if the disposition is extremely hot, the drug must be extremely cold; if the disposition falls a little short of the extreme, the drug too should fall a little short; and if the disposition is further from extreme heat, the drug should be analogously far from extreme coldness. For if you make the beginning of your investigation of them from such a calculation, you would more quickly discover the proper power of each. For in general, if any drug whatsoever, being hot, when applied to any single simple affliction, brought a sensation of cooling immediately upon its first application, that drug is cold in potentiality, and much more so if it remains so for all time after the first application. And if it completely cures the hot disposition, it is necessarily cold. But it must in every case be applied lukewarm when it is being tested, as was said before. Once it is known to be of such a nature, and is then employed for the sake of therapy, it is better to use it cold, unless the drug is extremely cold, while the disease is not extremely hot. These matters, then, will be discussed at greater length both in the works *On Drugs* and in the writings on the *Therapeutic Method*. For the present, one must know at least this much: that if any drug, when applied to a hot and simple disposition, brought the patient both a sensation of cooling and a feeling of comfort and benefit, both on the spot and in all the time thereafter, this drug is necessarily cold, even if on other occasions it appears to be hot. For upon precise examination in those other cases, it will be found to heat not in itself, but by some accident. And when we say \"in itself\" [καθ’ ἑαυτό], or \"primarily\" [πρώτως], or \"through no intermediary\" [διὰ μηδενὸς τῶν ἐν μέσῳ], the same thing is meant by all these expressions. And we shall conduct the exercise for all of these together, with their proper examples, in the treatises *On Drugs*.",

      "openai_translation": "Now then, recalling once more what I have already said before, I will try to bring the present discussion to its fitting conclusion. Since “the hot body” is spoken of in many ways—both as that which has the extreme quality [sc. of heat], as the element itself, and as what is so called by predominance [kata epikratēsin], and further as what is spoken of in relation to something else, whether in relation to what is proportionate and homogeneous, or to anything whatsoever by chance—so too must that which is potentially hot, though not yet in actuality, be both conceived and tested in many ways. Hence it is not correct, if something does not quickly catch fire, for some to suppose that it is not even potentially hot with respect to us. For if it is easy to digest and nourishes quickly, it would be hot with respect to us; or if, when applied as a drug, it produces warming, this too would be potentially hot as regards a human being. And in the same way, for each species of animal, what is potentially hot—whether as a drug or as a food—is spoken of only in relation to that particular animal. For everything potential is in the category of “relative,” so that the proper test is better than an external one. Proper, for each case, is a single thing: namely, if it should appear quickly to become such as we said it possesses the capacity to be. Fire is potentially anything that quickly becomes ignited; and potentially hot with respect to a human being—that was one form of what is called “hot” by predominance—when, upon being applied to a human, it increases either the quality of the innate warmth or the substance [sc. of the body]. The same statements must be understood to apply to the others as well, as many as are said to be cold and dry, and moist and hot in potentiality. For these too—some in relation to the elements themselves, others as named by predominance—must be conceived, tested, and taught accordingly. And it is clear that the discerning touch must be free from every acquired heat and cold, as has already been said also with respect to the drugs themselves.",
