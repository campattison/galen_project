Consequently, neither is it necessary that a hot mixture [krasis] should also be dry, but it is possible that sometimes the hot may predominate over the cold in the mixture of the living creature, while the moist predominates over the dry. For indeed generation, alteration, and change occur from contraries to contraries. For who, having said that the white has been altered and changed—for it has become hot—would not be laughable? For the argument seeks not the opposition according to cold and hot, but the change according to color. For the white changes into the black, just as the black also changes into the white, and the hot in turn into the cold, just as the cold also into the hot. And in the same way, the moist changes into the dry, and the dry in turn into the moist. For if someone should claim that the body has been altered because what was previously moist is now white, or because what was previously dry now appears black, he would not seem to be in his right mind. But if he should say that what was previously moist has now become dry, or that what was previously black is now white, or that it has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would seem to be sensible and to speak reasonably. For what changes, insofar as it changes, must in that respect move toward its opposite. At any rate, we say that this person has become or is becoming musical, clearly from being non-musical, and literate from being non-literate, and rhetorical from being non-rhetorical. But to say that something becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being grammatical, or that something comes to be from some other heterogeneous quality is absurd. For it is possible that one who was previously literate has now become musical, having acquired music in addition to literacy, not having lost literacy. And yet if he has acquired something while the former remains, it is surely clear to everyone that he has not been altered with respect to what remains. Therefore he has not become musical from being literate—for indeed he is still literate even now—but musical from being non-musical. For it is no longer possible for him to remain non-musical, having already become musical. Since, then, all changes occur by contraries, from contraries, and into contraries, clearly the moist too, if it ever changes, insofar as it is moist, will itself be dried and what dries it will be called dry. Therefore, they say, let them not say that it is impossible for a mixture to be both hot and moist at the same time. For it is impossible for the same thing to be both hot and cold at the same time, or both moist and dry at the same time; for it is not possible for contrary qualities to coexist in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be both moist and hot at the same time, and both cold and dry at the same time, as both reason has demonstrated and the examples given a little earlier.

Consequently, it is not necessary for a hot temperament [κρᾶσις] to be also a dry one, but it is possible at times for the hot to predominate over the cold in the temperament of a living being, and the wet over the dry. For indeed generation, alteration, and change occur from opposites and into opposites. For who, then, would not be ridiculous for saying that a white thing was altered and changed, on the grounds that it became hot? For the argument requires not the opposition between cold and hot, but the change with respect to color. For white changes into black, just as black also changes into white, and hot, in turn, into cold, just as cold also into hot. And so too the wet changes into the dry, and the dry, in turn, into the wet. For if someone were to claim that a body has been altered because, having previously been wet, it is now white, or because, being previously dry, it now appears black, he would not be thought to be of sound mind. But if he were to say that what was previously wet has now become dry, or that what was formerly black is now white, or has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would be thought to be sensible and to be saying what is reasonable. For that which changes must, in the very respect in which it changes, pass over to its opposite. For instance, we say that this man became or is becoming musical, clearly from being non-musical, and grammatical from being non-grammatical, and rhetorical from being non-rhetorical; but to say that something becomes grammatical from being musical, or musical from being grammatical, or that anything comes to be from something of a different kind, is absurd. For it is possible for one who was previously a grammarian to have now become a musician, having acquired music in addition to grammar, not by having lost his grammar. And surely, if he has acquired something while the previous state remains, it is clear to everyone, I suppose, that he has not been altered with respect to that which remains. Therefore, he did not become a musician *from* being a grammarian—for indeed he is still a grammarian now—but rather he became a musician from being unmusical; for it is no longer possible for him to remain unmusical, once he has already become a musician. Since, therefore, all changes are brought about by opposites and proceed from opposites into opposites, it is clear that the wet also, if it ever changes, insofar as it is wet, will itself be dried, and that which dries it will be called dry.\n\nTherefore, let them not say, they [the predecessors] argue, that it is impossible for a temperament to be at once hot and wet. For it is impossible for the same thing to be at once hot and cold, or at once wet and dry, since it is not possible for opposite qualities to coexist with each other in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be at once wet and hot, and at once cold and dry, as both the argument has demonstrated and the examples stated a little earlier.\n\nSuch, then, is the argument of our predecessors.",

For indeed, coming-to-be [genesis], alteration [alloiōsis], and change [metabolē] occur from contraries into contraries.\n\nFor who, if he said, “the white has been altered and has changed—for it became hot,” would not be laughable? For the account in question is seeking not the opposition according to cold and hot, but the change according to color; for white passes into black, just as black into white, and hot in turn into cold, just as cold into hot. And so too the moist into the dry, and again the dry into the moist. For if someone claims that the body has been altered in that what was formerly moist is now white, or in that what was formerly dry now appears black, he would seem not to be in his right mind.

For that which changes must, in the respect in which it changes, pass over toward its opposite.\n\nAt any rate, we say that this person has become or is becoming musical from being unmusical, plainly, and literate [grammatikos: trained in grammar] from being illiterate, and a rhetorician [rhetorikos] from being non-rhetorician; but to say that something becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being literate, or from some other heterogeneous thing, is absurd. For it is admissible that the one who was formerly literate has now become musical, having acquired music in addition to grammar, not having cast grammar away. And indeed, if he has acquired something while the former trait remains, it is clear to everyone that he has not been altered with respect to what remains. Accordingly, he did not become musical from being literate; for even now he is still literate. Rather, from being unmusical he is musical; for it is no longer possible for him to remain unmusical, seeing that he has already become musical.\n\nSince all changes, at any rate, occur both by contraries and from contraries into contraries, it is evident that the moist too, if it ever changes, inasmuch as it is moist, will itself be dried out, and that that which dries it will be called dry. Therefore, let them not say, they declare, that it is impossible for a hot-and-moist krasis to come to be at the same time. For the same thing cannot be at once hot and cold, or at once moist and dry; for contrary qualities cannot co-exist in one and the same body as such. But it is possible for something to be at once moist and hot, and at once cold and dry, as both the argument has shown and the examples mentioned a little earlier.

But the argument of those others does not demonstrate that it could never happen that in one and the same body the moist exceeds the dry while the hot exceeds the cold, but rather that such a state could not remain so forever; for the moist, being constantly evaporated by the hot, will in time render the body dry; and thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but would be hot and dry; and then again this very thing, the hot and dry, as time advances will become dry and cold. For whenever the hot has consumed all its moisture, from that point on, they say, it too begins to wither away, no longer having an abundant supply of the nourishment from which it was kindled. Therefore they consider it not at all remarkable that both at the beginning, right at the first generation of the animal, there should come together at the same time either the moist in excess of the dry, or the hot in excess of the cold, and that it is also possible, as time progresses, for the mixture that was previously hot and moist to become in turn hot and dry, just as again in turn the dry and hot mixture, when the hot is extinguished, becomes cold and dry.",

And thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but hot and dry; and this very state again, the hot and dry, as time advances will become dry and cold. For whenever the heat has consumed [lit. “grazed off”] all its moisture [ikmada: vital moisture/sap], from that point, they say, it too begins to wither, no longer being well supplied with the nourishment from which it had been kindled.\n\nAccordingly they think it nothing surprising that, at the outset—straightaway in the animal’s first coming-to-be—there should run together into one [subject] either an excess of the moist over the dry or of the hot over the cold. And as time goes on it is possible for the mixture that was previously hot and moist to become again hot and dry, just as, again in turn, when the heat is quenched, the dry and hot is brought to be cold and dry.",
