For who, then, by saying that \"the white thing was altered and changed, for it became hot,\" would not be ridiculous? For the argument requires not the opposition between cold and hot, but the change in respect to color. For white changes into black, just as black changes into white, and hot in turn into cold, just as cold into hot; and so also the moist into the dry, and the dry in turn into the moist.\n\nFor if someone were to assert that a body has been altered in that, having been moist before, it is now white, or in that, being dry before, it now appears black, he would not seem to be of sound mind. But if he were to say that what was formerly moist has now become dry, or that what was previously black is now white, or has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would seem to be sensible and to be speaking plausibly.",
