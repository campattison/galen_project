But now, which is the next topic following that one, I shall proceed in this present work to discover all the differences of mixtures [or temperaments], both how many they are and of what kind when divided into species and genera, having made a beginning from the explanation of the terms. For whenever they say that bodies are mixed from hot and cold and dry and moist, they assert that one must understand these in their extreme form, that is, the elements themselves—air and fire and water and earth; but whenever they say that an animal or plant is hot or cold or dry or moist, it is no longer in the same way. For no animal can be extremely hot like fire nor extremely moist like water. Similarly, neither can it be cold or dry in the extreme, but the designations arise from what predominates in the mixture, we calling \"moist\" that in which there is a greater portion of moisture, and \"dry\" that in which there is a greater portion of dryness; and likewise \"hot\" that in which the hot predominates over the cold, and \"cold\" that in which the cold predominates over the hot. This, then, is the usage of the terms.",

And I have also discussed what is appropriate concerning these matters in another treatise, in which I examined the elements according to Hippocrates. But now, in this present treatise, I shall proceed to the next topic, which is to discover all the differences among the mixtures—how many there are and of what sort, when divided by species and genera—beginning with an explanation of the terms.\n\nFor whenever they say that bodies are composed of a mixture of the hot, the cold, the dry, and the wet, they state that one must understand this to refer to these qualities in their absolute form [akrōs], that is, to the elements themselves: air, fire, water, and earth. But whenever they say that an animal or a plant is either hot or cold or dry or wet, this is no longer to be understood in the same way. For, they say, no animal can exist that is absolutely hot like fire, nor absolutely wet like water. And likewise, it cannot be cold or dry to the extreme; rather, the designations arise from the quality that predominates in the mixture, so that we call ‘wet’ that in which the proportion of wetness is greater, and ‘dry’ that in which the proportion of dryness is greater. And so also, we call ‘hot’ that in which the hot prevails over the cold, and ‘cold’ that in which the cold prevails over the hot. This, then, is the use of the terms.",

For no living thing can be at the extreme of heat like fire, nor at the extreme of moistness like water; and likewise neither at the uttermost cold nor at the uttermost dryness. Rather, the designations arise from what predominates in the mixture, so that we call moist that in which there is a greater share of moistness, and dry, that in which there is dryness; and in the same way, hot is that in which the hot predominates over the cold, and cold, that in which the cold predominates over the hot.
