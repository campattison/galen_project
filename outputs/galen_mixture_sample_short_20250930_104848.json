For whenever they say that bodies are mixed from hot and cold and dry and moist, they assert that one must understand these in their extreme form, that is, the elements themselves: air, fire, water, and earth. But whenever they speak of an animal, or a plant, as hot, or cold, or dry, or moist, it is no longer in the same way. For no animal can be extremely hot, like fire, nor extremely moist, like water; and likewise neither extremely cold nor extremely dry. Rather, the designations arise from what predominates in the mixture, we calling \"moist\" that in which there is a greater share of moisture, and \"dry\" that in which there is a greater share of dryness; and similarly \"hot\" that in which the hot predominates over the cold, and \"cold\" that in which the cold predominates over the hot.

Consequently, neither is it necessary that a hot mixture [*krasis*, blend or temperament] should also be dry, but it is possible sometimes for the hot to predominate over the cold in the mixture of the living creature, and the moist over the dry. For indeed both generation and alteration and change occur from contraries into contraries. For who, having said that the white has been altered and changed—for it has become hot—would not be laughable? For the argument seeks not the opposition according to cold and hot, but the change according to color. For the white changes into the black, just as the black also changes into the white, and the hot in turn into the cold, just as the cold also into the hot. And so too the moist into the dry, and the dry in turn into the moist. For if someone should claim that the body has been altered by the fact that what was formerly moist is now white, or by the fact that what was formerly dry now appears black, he would not seem to be in his right mind. But if he should say that what was formerly moist has now become dry, or that what was previously black is now white, or that it has become cold from hot, or hot from cold, such a person would seem to be sensible and to speak reasonably. For what changes, insofar as it changes, must in that respect move toward its opposite. \"This person has become or is becoming musical,\" we say, clearly from being non-musical, and literate from being non-literate, and rhetorical from being non-rhetorical. But to say that something becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being literate, or that something comes to be from some other heterogeneous quality is absurd. For it is possible that one who was formerly literate has now become musical, having acquired music in addition to literacy, not having cast off literacy. And yet if he has acquired something in addition while the former quality remains, it is surely clear to everyone that he has not been altered with respect to what remains. So he has not become musical from being literate—for indeed he is still literate even now—but musical from being non-musical. For it is no longer possible for him to remain non-musical, having already become musical. Since, then, all changes occur by contraries and from contraries into contraries, clearly also the moist, if it ever changes, insofar as it is moist, will itself be dried and what dries it will be called dry. Therefore, they say, let them not say that it is impossible for a mixture to be both hot and moist at the same time. For it is impossible for the same thing to be both hot and cold at the same time, or both moist and dry at the same time; for it is not possible for contrary qualities to coexist with one another in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be both moist and hot at the same time, and both cold and dry at the same time, as both reason has demonstrated and the examples given a little earlier. Such, then, is the argument of the earlier thinkers.",

      "gemini_translation": "Thus, it is not necessary, either that if something is cold, it is immediately also moist, or that if something is hot, it is immediately also dry. Therefore, a hot temperament [κρᾶσις] is not necessarily also a dry one, but it is possible for the hot to predominate over the cold in the temperament of a living being, while the moist predominates over the dry. For indeed, generation, alteration [ἀλλοίωσις, qualitative change], and change [μεταβολή, general change] all occur from opposites into their opposites. For who, then, would not be ridiculous for saying that \"the white thing was altered and changed, for it became hot\"? For the argument requires not the opposition between cold and hot, but the change in respect to color. For white changes into black, just as black also changes into white, and hot, in turn, into cold, just as cold also changes into hot. And so too does the moist change into the dry, and the dry, in turn, into the moist. For if someone were to claim that a body has been altered because what was formerly moist is now white, or because what was formerly dry now appears black, he would not seem to be of sound mind. But if he were to say that what was formerly moist has now become dry, or that what was previously black is now white, or that it has become cold from being hot, or hot from being cold, such a person would seem to be sensible and to be speaking plausibly. For that which changes must, in the respect in which it changes, pass over to its opposite.\n\nFor instance, we say that this man became, or is becoming, a musician from being non-musical, obviously; and a grammarian from being non-grammatical, and a rhetorician from being non-rhetorical. But to say that someone becomes a grammarian from being a musician, or a musician from being a grammarian, or that anything comes to be from something else of a different kind [ἑτερογενῶν], is absurd. For it is possible for one who was formerly a grammarian to have now become a musician, by acquiring the art of music in addition to the art of grammar, not by casting off the art of grammar. And surely, if he acquired something new while the former quality remained, it is clear to everyone that he was not altered with respect to that which remained. Thus, he did not become a musician *from* being a grammarian—for indeed he is still a grammarian now—but rather a musician *from* being unmusical; for it is no longer possible for him to remain unmusical, once he has already become a musician.\n\nTherefore, since all changes are brought about by opposites and proceed from opposites to opposites, it is clear that the moist, if it ever changes *qua* moist, will itself be dried, and that which dries it will be called dry. Let them not, therefore, say—as they do—that it is impossible for a temperament to be at once hot and moist. For it is impossible for the same thing to be at once hot and cold, or at once moist and dry, for it is not possible for opposite qualities to coexist with one another in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be at once moist and hot, and at once cold and dry, as both the argument has demonstrated and the examples mentioned a short while ago have shown.\n\nSuch, then, is the argument of the earlier thinkers.",

Hence a hot blend [krasis: mixture/temperament] is not of necessity also dry; rather, it can happen at times that, in the mixture of a living creature, the hot prevails over the cold, while the moist prevails over the dry. For indeed both coming-to-be, alteration, and change [genesis, alloiōsis, metabolē] occur from contraries into contraries. For who would not be laughable if he said, “The white thing has been altered and has changed—for it became hot”? For the discussion is looking not for the opposition according to cold and hot, but for the change according to color; for white changes into black, just as black into white, and again the hot into the cold, just as the cold into the hot. And so too the moist into the dry, and in turn the dry into the moist. For if someone claims that the body has been altered in that, being formerly moist, it is now white, or in that, being formerly dry, it now appears black, he would seem not to be in his right mind. But if he were to say that what was formerly moist has now become dry, or that what previously existed as black is now white, or that from being hot it has become cold, or from being cold hot, such a person would seem sensible and to be speaking plausibly. For that which changes must, in the very respect in which it changes, pass over toward the opposite.\n\nAccordingly, we say “This person became, or becomes, musical from being unmusical, plainly, and literate from being illiterate, and a rhetorician from not being a rhetorician” [grammatikos: literate, skilled in letters]; but it is absurd to say that something becomes literate from being musical, or musical from being literate, or from something else among things of a different kind [heterogeneous]. For it is admissible that someone who was previously literate has now become musical, having acquired music in addition to literacy, not having discarded literacy. And indeed, if he has acquired something while the former state remains, it is clear to everyone, I suppose, that he has not been altered with respect to what remains. Therefore he did not become musical from being literate; for even now he is still literate. Rather, he became musical from being unmusical; for it is no longer possible for him to remain unmusical, once he has already become musical. Since, at any rate, all changes are brought about both by contraries and from contraries into contraries, it is evident that the moist too, if it ever changes, in so far as it is moist, will itself be dried, and what dries it will be said to be dry.\n\nTherefore, let no one, as they say, assert that it is impossible for a blend to come to be both hot and moist at once. For it is not possible for the same thing to be both hot and cold at the same time, nor both moist and dry; for it is not possible for contrary qualities to co-exist in one and the same body. But it is possible for something to be at once moist and hot, and at once cold and dry, as both the argument has shown and the examples mentioned a little earlier.

But the argument of those people does not demonstrate that it could never happen that in one and the same body the moist exceeds the dry while the hot exceeds the cold, but rather that such a state could not remain so forever. For the moisture, being constantly evaporated by the heat, will in time render the body dry; and thus it would no longer be hot and moist, but would be hot and dry.
